ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n-1. DEFINITIONS\n-\"Contribution\" means:\n-a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n-b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n-i) changes to the Program, and\n-ii) additions to the Program;\n-where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n-\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n-\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n-\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n-\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n-b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n-d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n-a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-b) its license agreement:\n-i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n-ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-7. GENERAL\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n+== License Type\n+SPDX:ISC\n@@ -708,6 +722,2 @@\n-This product includes code (JaspellTernarySearchTrie) from Java Spelling Checkin\n-g Package (jaspell): http:\/\/jaspell.sourceforge.net\/\n-License: The BSD License (http:\/\/www.opensource.org\/licenses\/bsd-license.php)\n-------------------------------\n-The 2-Clause BSD License\n-------------------------------\n+== Copyright\n+Copyright 2010-2021 Mike Bostock\n@@ -715,1 +725,1 @@\n-Copyright  \n+--------------------------------- (separator) ----------------------------------\n@@ -717,1 +727,2 @@\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n+== Dependency\n+d3-brush\n@@ -719,1 +730,2 @@\n-1.

Distribution Obligations.\n-\n-  3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n-\n-  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n-  in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form\n-  and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms\n-  of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every\n-  copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute\n-  or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\n-  Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\n-  Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\n-  through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-  3.2. Modifications.\n-\n-  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n-  governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You\n-  believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and\/or You\n-  have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n-\n-  3.3. Required Notices.\n-\n-  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\n-  identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not\n-  remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained\n-  within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any\n-  descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the\n-  Initial Developer.\n-\n-  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n-\n-  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\n-  Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of\n-  this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to\n-  offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n-  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n-  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n-  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n-  absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n-  liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n-  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n-  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n-  result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n-\n-  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n-\n-  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under\n-  the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your\n-  choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n-  provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n-  and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to\n-  limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from\n-  the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered\n-  Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make\n-  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\n-  are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or\n-  Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n-  every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n-  Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n-\n-  3.6. Larger Works.\n-\n-  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with\n-  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute\n-  the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n-  sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n-  Software.\n-\n-4. Versions of the License.\n-\n-  4.1. New Versions.\n-\n-  Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and\/or\n-  new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\n-  given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section\n-  4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify\n-  this License.\n-\n-  4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n-\n-  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n-  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n-  License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n-  the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n-  prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n-  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n-  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\n-  of the License under which You originally received the Covered\n-  Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\n-  otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\n-  subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n-\n-  4.3. Modified Versions.\n-\n-  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n-  license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n-  modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and\n-  remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to\n-  note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise\n-  make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this\n-  License.\n-\n-5.

SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n-  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n-  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n-  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n-  ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS\n-  AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n-\n-6. TERMINATION.\n-\n-  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n-  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n-  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n-  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n-  termination of this License shall survive.\n-\n-  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n-  declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n-  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n-  assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the\n-  Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n-  Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n-  Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n-  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n-  indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n-  Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n-  Sections 2.1 and\/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice\n-  from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\n-  expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60\n-  day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n-  Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to\n-  a written agreement with Participant.\n-\n-  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n-  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly\n-  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\n-  license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n-  infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n-  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n-  into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n-  license.\n-\n-  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\n-  all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n-  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n-  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n-\n-7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n-\n-  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n-  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n-  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n-  COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\n-  TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n-  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n-  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n-  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n-  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n-  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n-  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n-  PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n-  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n-  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n-  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n-\n-8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n-\n-  The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n-  in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n-  software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. �\n-  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\"\n-  as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n-  with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n-  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n-  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n-  clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other\n-  clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\n-  software under this License.\n-\n-9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n-\n-  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n-  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n-  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n-  the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\n-  the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n-  provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\n-  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\n-  to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\n-  venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\n-  with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n-  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n-  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n-  the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n-  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\n-  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You\n-  agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n-  States export administration regulations (and the export control\n-  laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute\n-  or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n-\n-10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n-\n-  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n-  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n-  out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n-  work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n-  responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n-  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n-\n-NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\n-\n-The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\n-State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any\n-litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\n-of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the\n-state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\n-County, California.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n-51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n-Boston, MA 02110-1335\n-USA\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n-of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n-\n-Preamble\n-\n-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n-License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n-to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n-Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n-Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n-Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n-service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n-free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n-to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n-restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n-You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n-And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n-We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n-proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n-be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n-the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n-to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n-either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n-to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n-verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n-(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n-\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n-the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n-covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n-(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n-is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n-and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n-and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n-this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n-recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n-it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n-such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n-that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n-    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n-    under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n-    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n-    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n-    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n-    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n-    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n-    is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n-can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n-the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n-License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n-scope of this License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n-    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n-    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n-    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n-    accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n-compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n-exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n-executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n-to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n-the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n-code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n-along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n-to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n-automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n-who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n-not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n-its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n-Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n-on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n-responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n-so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n-any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n-distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n-not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n-receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n-could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n-distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n-by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n-contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n-system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n-the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n-software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n-a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n-add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n-countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n-not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n-limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n-Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n-author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n-Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n-sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n-two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n-software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n-WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n-ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n-YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12.

It is safest to\n-attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n-the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-    (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n-    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n-    General Public License for more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n-when it starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n-    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n-    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\n-appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\n-you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n-could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n-school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n-necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n-    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n-    James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\n-into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\n-may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\n-with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\n-General Public License instead of this License.\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and\/or its\n-affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\n-exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\n-Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\n-where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\n-header the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\n-the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\n-that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\n-programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\n-under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\n-Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\n-licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\n-licensed to you under their original licenses.\n-\n-Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\n-the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\n-permits you to use that code in combination with other independent\n-modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\n-not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\n-Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\n-code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\n-distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\n-Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\n-distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\n-all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\n-since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\n-included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\n-Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\n-further distribute the package.\n-\n-Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\n-lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\n-Exception or making modifications to this package which may\n-subsequently be redistributed and\/or involve the use of third party\n-software.\n-\n-CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\n-\n-Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\n-making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\n-conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\n-combination.\n-\n-As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\n-modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\n-terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\n-independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\n-module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\n-based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\n-exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\n-do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\n-from your version.\n-\n-\n-------\n-Assorted\n-\n-The UnixCrypt.java code implements the one way cryptography used by\n-Unix systems for simple password protection.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\n-CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n-\n-1. DEFINITIONS\n-\n-\"Contribution\" means:\n-\n-a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation\n-   distributed under this Agreement, and\n-b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n-    i) changes to the Program, and\n-   ii) additions to the Program;\n-\n-   where such changes and\/or additions to the Program originate from and are\n-   distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\n-   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n-   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n-   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n-   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n-   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n-\n-\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n-\n-\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\n-necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\n-combined with the Program.\n-\n-\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\n-Agreement.\n-\n-\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\n-including all Contributors.\n-\n-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n-     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n-     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n-     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n-     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n-     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n-     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n-     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n-     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n-     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n-     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n-     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n-     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n-     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n-     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n-     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n-     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n-     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n-     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n-     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n-     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n-     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n-     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-     before distributing the Program.\n-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n-     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n-     license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\n-its own license agreement, provided that:\n-\n-  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n-  b) its license agreement:\n-      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n-         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n-         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n-         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n-     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n-         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n-         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n-         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n-     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n-         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n-         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n-\n-When the Program is made available in source code form:\n-\n-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n-     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n-     within the Program.\n-\n-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\n-if\n-any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\n-originator of the Contribution.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\n-respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\n-intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\n-which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\n-if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\n-Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\n-every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\n-other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\n-Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\n-product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\n-or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n-infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\n-a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\n-b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\n-Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\n-negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\n-its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\n-offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\n-that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\n-warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\n-such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\n-Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\n-Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\n-court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\n-Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n-\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n-NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\n-Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\n-and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n-exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\n-risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\n-or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\n-operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\n-CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\n-SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\n-LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\n-OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n-remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\n-parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\n-necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\n-cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n-(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\n-infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\n-under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\n-comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\n-not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\n-such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\n-Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\n-reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\n-and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\n-and survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\n-order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\n-modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\n-publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\n-time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\n-Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\n-Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\n-Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\n-be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n-Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\n-Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n-(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\n-stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\n-licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\n-whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\n-Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n-\n-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\n-intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\n-Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\n-after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\n-any resulting litigation.\n-\n-#################License text for MAIN component################\n-\n-                                 Apache License\n-                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n-                        http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/\n-\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-   1.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-\n-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n-  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n-  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n-  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n-  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n-\n-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n-  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n-  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n-  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n-  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n-  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n-  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n-  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n-  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n-  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n-  licensed hereunder.\n-\n-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n-  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n-  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n-  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n-  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n-  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n-  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n-  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n-  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n-  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n-  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-  before distributing the Program.\n-\n-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n-  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n-  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n-  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n-  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n-  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n-\n-  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n-  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n-  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n-  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n-  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n-  used for software exchange; and\n-\n-  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n-  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n-     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n-     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n-     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n-     for a particular purpose;\n-\n-     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n-     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n-     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n-\n-     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n-     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n-     of this section 3.\n-\n-3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n-\n-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n-  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n-  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n-  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n-  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n-  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n-\n-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n-  the Program.\n-\n-3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n-trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n-of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n-the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n-their own appropriate notices.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n-with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n-license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n-the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n-offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n-liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n-the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n-(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n-other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n-and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n-Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n-in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n-apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n-intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n-Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n-writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n-and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n-participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n-product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n-Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n-claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n-claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n-alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n-defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n-claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n-pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n-those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n-TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n-appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n-risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n-including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n-compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n-or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n-SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n-EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n-the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n-action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n-minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n-or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n-rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n-litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n-fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n-Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n-time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n-rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n-and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n-However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n-granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n-but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n-may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n-reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n-this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n-Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n-is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n-responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n-entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n-version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n-Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n-received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n-Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n-Contributions) under the new version.\n-\n-Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n-receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n-Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n-estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n-under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n-to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n-No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n-\n-Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n-\n-\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\n-Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\n-in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\n-version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n-\n-  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n-  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n-\n-  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n-  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n-  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n-  look for such a notice.\n-\n-  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n-\n-Apache License - v 2.0\n-                             Apache License\n-                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n-                    http:\/\/www.apache.org\/licenses\/\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-\n-Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n-\n-  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n-  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n-  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n-  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n-  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n-  used for software exchange; and\n-\n-  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n-  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n-     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n-     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n-     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n-     for a particular purpose;\n-\n-     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n-     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n-     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n-\n-     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n-     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n-     of this section 3.\n-\n-3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n-\n-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n-  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n-  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n-  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n-  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n-  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n-\n-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n-  the Program.\n-\n-3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n-trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n-of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n-the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n-their own appropriate notices.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n-with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n-license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n-the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n-offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n-liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n-the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n-(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n-other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n-and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n-Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n-in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n-apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n-intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n-Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n-writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n-and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n-participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n-product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n-Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n-claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n-claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n-alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n-defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n-claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n-pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n-those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n-TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n-appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n-risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n-including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n-compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n-or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n-SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n-EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n-the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n-action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n-minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n-or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n-rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n-litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n-fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n-Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n-time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n-rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n-and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n-However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n-granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n-but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n-may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n-reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n-this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n-Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n-is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n-responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n-entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n-version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n-Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n-received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n-Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n-Contributions) under the new version.\n-\n-Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n-receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n-Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n-estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n-under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n-to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n-No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n-\n-Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n-\n-\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \n-Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \n-in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\n-version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n-\n-  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n-  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n-\n-  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n-  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n-  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n-  look for such a notice.\n-\n-  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n-\n-====================================\n-The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n-====================================\n-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n-51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n-Boston, MA 02110-1335\n-USA\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n-of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n-\n-Preamble\n-\n-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n-License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n-to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n-Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n-Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n-Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n-service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n-free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n-to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n-restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n-You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n-And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n-We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n-proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n-be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n-the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n-to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n-either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n-to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n-verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n-(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n-\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n-the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n-covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n-(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n-is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n-and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n-and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n-this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n-recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n-it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n-such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n-that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n-    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n-    under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n-    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n-    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n-    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n-    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n-    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n-    is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n-can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n-the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n-License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n-scope of this License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n-    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n-    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n-    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n-    accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n-compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n-exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n-executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n-to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n-the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n-code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n-along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n-to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n-automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n-who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n-not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n-its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n-Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n-on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n-responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n-so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n-any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n-distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n-not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n-receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n-could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n-distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n-by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n-contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n-system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n-the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n-software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n-a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n-add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n-countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n-not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n-limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n-Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n-author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n-Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n-sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n-two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n-software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n-WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n-ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n-YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n-DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n-DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n-(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n-INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n-THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n-OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n-attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n-the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-    (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n-    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n-    General Public License for more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n-when it starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n-    `show w'.

Of course, the commands\n-you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n-could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n-school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n-necessary.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n-\n-  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n-  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n-  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n-  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n-  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n-\n-  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n-  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n-  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n-  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n-  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n-  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n-  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n-  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n-  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n-  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n-  licensed hereunder.\n-\n-  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n-  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n-  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n-  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n-  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n-  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n-  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n-  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n-  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n-  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n-  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-  before distributing the Program.\n-\n-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n-  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n-  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n-  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n-  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n-  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n-\n-3. REQUIREMENTS\n-\n-3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n-\n-  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n-  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n-  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n-  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n-  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n-  used for software exchange; and\n-\n-  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n-  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n-     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n-     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n-     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n-     for a particular purpose;\n-\n-     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n-     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n-     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n-\n-     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n-     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n-\n-     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n-     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n-     of this section 3.\n-\n-3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n-\n-  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n-  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n-  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n-  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n-  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n-  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n-\n-  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n-  the Program.\n-\n-3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n-trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n-of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n-the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n-their own appropriate notices.\n-\n-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n-\n-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n-with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n-license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n-the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n-offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n-liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n-the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n-(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n-other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n-damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n-and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n-Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n-Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n-in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n-apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n-intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n-Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n-writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n-and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n-related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n-participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n-\n-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n-product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n-Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n-claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n-claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n-alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n-defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n-claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n-pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n-those damages.\n-\n-5. NO WARRANTY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n-BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n-IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n-TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n-appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n-risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n-including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n-compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n-or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n-\n-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n-\n-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n-PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n-SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n-EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n-PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n-CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n-ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n-EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-7. GENERAL\n-\n-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n-the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n-action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n-minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n-\n-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n-or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n-rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n-litigation is filed.\n-\n-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n-fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n-Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n-time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n-rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n-and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n-However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n-granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n-but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n-may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n-reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n-this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n-Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n-is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n-responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n-entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n-version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n-Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n-received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n-Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n-Contributions) under the new version.\n-\n-Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n-receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n-Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n-estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n-under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n-to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n-No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n-\n-Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n-\n-\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \n-Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \n-in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\n-version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n-\n-  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n-  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n-\n-  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n-  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n-  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n-  look for such a notice.\n-\n-  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n-51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n-Boston, MA 02110-1335\n-USA\n-\n-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n-of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n-\n-Preamble\n-\n-The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n-share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n-License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n-to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n-Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n-Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n-Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n-service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n-free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n-to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n-restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n-You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n-And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n-We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n-proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n-be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n-the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n-to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n-either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n-to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n-verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n-(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n-\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n-the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n-covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n-(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n-is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n-and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n-and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n-this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n-recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n-it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n-such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n-that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n-    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n-    under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n-    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n-    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n-    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n-    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n-    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n-    is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n-can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n-the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n-License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n-scope of this License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n-    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n-    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n-    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n-    accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n-compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n-exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n-executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n-to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n-the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n-code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n-along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n-to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n-automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n-who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n-not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n-its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n-Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n-on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n-responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n-so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n-any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n-distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n-not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n-receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n-could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n-distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n-by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n-contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n-system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n-the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n-software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n-a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n-add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n-countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n-not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n-limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n-Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n-author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n-Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n-sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n-two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n-software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n-WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n-ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n-YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n-DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n-DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n-(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n-INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n-THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n-OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n-attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n-the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-    (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n-    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n-    General Public License for more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n-    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n-    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n-when it starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n-    `show w'.

Of course, the commands\n-you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\n-could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n-school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n-necessary.

If your program is a subroutine library, you\n-may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\n-with the library.

As a condition to exercising the\n-  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n-  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n-  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n-  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n-  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n-  before distributing the Program.\n-\n-  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n-  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n-  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n-\n-  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n-  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n-  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n-  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n-  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n-\n-3.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n-License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n-to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n-Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n-Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n-Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n-service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n-free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n-to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n-restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n-You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n-And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n-We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n-proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n-be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n-the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n-to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n-either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n-to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n-verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n-(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n-\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n-the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n-covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n-(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n-is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n-and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n-and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n-this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n-recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n-it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n-such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n-that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n-    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n-    under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n-    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n-    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n-    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n-    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n-    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n-    is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n-can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n-the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n-License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n-scope of this License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n-    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n-    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n-    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n-    accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n-compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n-exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n-executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n-to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n-the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n-code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n-along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n-to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n-automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n-who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n-not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n-its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n-Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n-on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n-responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n-so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n-any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n-distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n-not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n-receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n-could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n-distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n-by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n-contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n-system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n-the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n-software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n-a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n-add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n-countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n-not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n-limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n-Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n-author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n-Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n-sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n-two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n-software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n-WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n-ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\n-YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n-NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\n-DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n-DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n-(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\n-INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\n-THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\n-OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n-attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\n-the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-    (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n-    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n+\n+      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n+      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n+      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n+      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n+      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n+\n+      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n+      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n+      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n+      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n+      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n+      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n+      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n+      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n+      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n+      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n+      licensed hereunder.\n+\n+      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n+      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n+      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n+      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n+      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n+      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n+      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n+      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n+      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n+      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n+      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n+      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n+      before distributing the Program.\n+\n+      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n+      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n+      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n+\n+      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n+      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n+      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n+      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n+      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n+\n+    3. REQUIREMENTS\n+\n+    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n+\n+      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n+      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n+      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n+      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n+      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n+      used for software exchange; and\n+\n+      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n+      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n+         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n+         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n+         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n+         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n+         for a particular purpose;\n+\n+         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n+         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n+         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n+\n+         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n+         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n+\n+         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n+         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n+         of this section 3.\n+\n+    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n+\n+      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n+      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n+      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n+      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n+      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n+      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n+\n+      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n+      the Program.\n+\n+    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n+    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n+    of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n+    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n+    their own appropriate notices.\n+\n+    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n+\n+    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n+    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n+    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n+    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n+    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n+    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n+    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n+    (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n+    other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n+    damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n+    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n+    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n+    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n+    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n+    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n+    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n+    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n+    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n+    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n+    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n+    participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n+\n+    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n+    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n+    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n+    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n+    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n+    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n+    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n+    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n+    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n+    those damages.\n+\n+    5. NO WARRANTY\n+\n+    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n+    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n+    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n+    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n+    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n+    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n+    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n+    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n+    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n+    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n+    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n+\n+    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n+\n+    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n+    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n+    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n+    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n+    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n+    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n+    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n+    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n+    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+    7. GENERAL\n+\n+    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n+    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n+    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n+    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n+    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n+\n+    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n+    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n+    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n+    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n+    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n+    litigation is filed.\n+\n+    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n+    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n+    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n+    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n+    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n+    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n+    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n+    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n+\n+    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n+    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n+    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n+    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n+    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n+    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n+    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n+    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n+    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n+    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n+    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n+    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n+    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n+    Contributions) under the new version.\n+\n+    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n+    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n+    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n+    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n+    under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\n+    to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\n+    No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n+\n+    Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n+\n+    \"This Source Code may also be made available under the following \n+    Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth \n+    in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\n+    version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n+\n+      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n+      is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n+\n+      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n+      file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n+      file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n+      look for such a notice.\n+\n+      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n+\n+    Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\n+    Boston, MA 02110-1335\n+    USA\n+\n+    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n+    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n+\n+    Preamble\n+\n+    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\n+    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n+    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n+    make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n+    License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n+    to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n+    Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n+    Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n+\n+    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n+    Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n+    freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n+    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n+    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n+    free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n+    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n+    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n+    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n+\n+    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n+    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n+    You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n+    And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+    distribute and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n+    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n+    authors' reputations.\n+\n+    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n+    We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n+    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n+    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n+    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+    modification follow.\n+\n+    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n+    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n+    the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n+    to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n+    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n+    to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n+    verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n+    (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n+    \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n+    the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n+    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n+    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n+    is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n+    code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n+    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n+    and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n+    this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n+    recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n+    it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n+    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n+    that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n+        thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n+        under the terms of this License.\n+\n+        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n+        that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n+        warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n+        conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n+        (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n+        normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n+        is not required to print an announcement.)\n+\n+    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n+    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n+    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n+    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n+    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n+    License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n+    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+    collective works based on the Program.\n+\n+    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n+    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n+    storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n+    scope of this License.\n+\n+    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n+    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n+    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n+        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n+        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n+        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n+        of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n+        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n+        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n+        customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n+        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n+        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n+        program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n+        accord with Subsection b above.)\n+\n+    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n+    means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n+    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n+    compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n+    exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n+    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n+    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n+    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n+    executable.\n+\n+    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n+    to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n+    the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n+    code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n+    along with the object code.\n+\n+    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n+    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n+    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n+    automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n+    who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n+    not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n+    full compliance.\n+\n+    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n+    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n+    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n+    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n+    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n+    Program or works based on it.\n+\n+    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n+    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n+    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n+    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

If you cannot distribute\n+    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n+    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n+    distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n+    not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n+    receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n+    could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n+    distribution of the Program.\n+\n+    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n+    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n+    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n+    circumstances.\n+\n+    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n+    by public license practices. Many people have made generous\n+    contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\n+    system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\n+    the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\n+    software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n+\n+    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\n+    a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\n+    8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n+    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n+    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n+    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n+    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n+    limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n+\n+    9.

Such new\n+    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n+    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n+    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n+    later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n+    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n+    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n+    Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n+    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n+    author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n+    Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n+    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n+    two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n+    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n+\n+    NO WARRANTY\n+\n+    11.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\n-intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\n-make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\n-License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\n-to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\n-Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\n-Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n-Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\n-freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\n-service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n-free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\n-to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\n-restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\n-You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\n-And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n-We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\n-proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n-be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\n-notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\n-the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\n-to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\n-either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\n-to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\n-verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.\n-(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n-\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n-the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\n-covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n-(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\n-is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\n-code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\n-and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\n-and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\n-this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\n-recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\n-it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\n-such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\n-that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n-    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n-    under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n-    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n-    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n-    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n-    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n-    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n-    is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\n-can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\n-the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\n-License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\n-storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\n-scope of this License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n-    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n-    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n-    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n-    accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\n-means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\n-compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\n-exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\n-executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\n-to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\n-the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\n-code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\n-along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\n-to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n-automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n-who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\n-not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\n-full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\n-its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\n-Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\n-on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\n-responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\n-so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\n-any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\n-distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\n-not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\n-receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\n-could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\n-distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\n-by public license practices.

If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\n-add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\n-countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\n-not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\n-limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\n-versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\n-differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\n-number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\n-Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\n-author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\n-Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\n-sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\n-two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\n-software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n-EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n-WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
