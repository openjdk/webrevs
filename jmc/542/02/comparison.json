With parallel (multi-threaded) collector events, the \"user\" + \"sys\" time should be approximately equal to the \"real\" (wall) time multiplied by the # of GC threads. For example, if there are 3 GC threads we would expect a parallel collection that takes 1 second of \"real\" time to take approximately 3 seconds of \"user\" + \"sys\" time. The parallelism is 3x. If the parallelism is 1x (\"user\" + \"sys\" = \"real\"), the parallel collection is not offering any efficiency over a serial (single-threaded) collection. When \"user\" + \"sys\" &lt; \"real\", the parallelism is inverted. Inverted parallelism can be a sign of high i\/o (e.g. disk or network access) or not enough CPU (e.g. GC threads competing with each other or other processes).

With parallel (multi-threaded) collector events, the \"user\" + \"sys\" time should be approximately equal to the \"real\" (wall) time multiplied by the # of GC threads.

If the parallelism is 1x (\"user\" + \"sys\" = \"real\"), the parallel collection is not offering any efficiency over a serial (single-threaded) collection. When \"user\" + \"sys\" &lt; \"real\", the parallelism is inverted.
