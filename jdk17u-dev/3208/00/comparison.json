But we disable\n+    \/\/    PhaseIdealLoop::try_move_store_after_loop by setting -XX:-SplitIfBlocks.\n+    \/\/  - The field loads are folded away because of some MaxUnroll trick, where the val constant folds to 1.\n+    \/\/  - SuperWord eventually kicks in, and vectorizes the array stores.\n+    \/\/  - Since some vectorization has happened, SuperWord wants to align the main loop with a memory reference\n+    \/\/    in the loop. The code here is not very smart, and just picks the memory reference that occurs the\n+    \/\/    most often. But the B::offset stores occur more often than the array stores, and so we align to\n+    \/\/    one of the B::offset stores. This inserts a CastP2X under the CheckCastPP of the B allocation.\n+    \/\/  - Once loop opts is over, we eventually go into macro expansion.\n+    \/\/  - During macro expansion, we now discover that the Allocations were marked NoEscape, and that by now\n+    \/\/    there are no field loads any more: yay, we can remove the allocation!\n+    \/\/  - ... except that there is the CastP2X from SuperWord alignment ...\n+    \/\/  - The Allocation removal code wants to pattern match the CastP2X as part of a GC barrier, but then\n+    \/\/    the pattern does not conform to the expecatation - it is after all from SuperWord.
