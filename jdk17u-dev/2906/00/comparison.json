These failures will manifest\n+        \/\/ as timeouts. The failures depend on timing: they may not happen at all, be intermittent or\n+        \/\/ constant.\n+        \/\/\n+        \/\/ That will rarely be a problem on bare-metal systems but may be more common when running in\n+        \/\/ Docker.
