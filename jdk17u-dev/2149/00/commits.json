[{"commit":{"message":"8324234: Use reserved IP for java.net testing\n\nSome tests like test\/jdk\/java\/net\/Socket\/B8312065.java use specific IPs (like 192.168.255.255) taking the assumption that the address is not going to be assigned. This doesn't always hold true, as 192.168.255.255 for example is a valid address.\n\nRFC 5737 [1] defines specific ranges of IP addresses that may are reserved for these exact purpose and that will never be assigned. Let's make sure to use an IP in this range, like 192.0.2.1 for example.\n\nThe specific test test\/jdk\/java\/net\/Socket\/B8312065.java was introduced with https:\/\/git.openjdk.org\/jdk17u-dev\/pull\/1639.\n\n[1] https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/rfc\/rfc5737"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/java\/net\/Socket\/B8312065.java"}],"sha":"1f3cbe4f7a4004186a7ccca663ace1d17023d7e7"}]
