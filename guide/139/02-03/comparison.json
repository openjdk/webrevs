In general, you should link any other issue that has a bearing on the situation where you feel the related issue should be reviewed in order to have a better understanding of what is going on\n+‘relates to’ - To avoid lots of relates links, the links should have some significance in relation to the cause and\/or fix, for the current issue. In addition, relates links should not duplicate an existing `duplicated by`, `backported by`, `csr for` or `blocked by` link.  In particular, it may be necessary to manually remove a `relates to` link if it is later added as a `duplicated by` or `caused by` link\n","filename":"src\/guide\/jbs-jdk-bug-system.md","additions":2,"deletions":2,"binary":false,"changes":4,"status":"modified"}]}
