Therefore, there are three main\n+         * cases to consider:\n+         *\n+         * 1) Large exponent product, exponent > Float16.MAX_EXPONENT\n+         *\n+         * The magnitude of the overflow threshold for Float16 is:\n+         *\n+         * MAX_VALUE + 1\/2 * ulp(MAX_VALUE) =  0x1.ffcp15 + 0x0.002p15 = 0x1.ffep15\n+         *\n+         * Therefore, for any product greater than or equal in\n+         * magnitude to (0x1.ffep15 + MAX_VALUE) = 0x1.ffdp16, the\n+         * final fma result will certainly overflow to infinity (under\n+         * round to nearest) since adding in c = -MAX_VALUE will still\n+         * be at or above the overflow threshold.\n+         *\n+         * If the exponent of the product is 15 or 16, the smallest\n+         * subnormal Float16 is 2^-24 and the ~40 bit wide range bit\n+         * positions would fit in a single double exactly.\n+         *\n+         * 2) Exponent of product is within the range of _normal_\n+         * Float16 values; Float16.MIN_EXPONENT <=  exponent <= Float16.MAX_EXPONENT\n+         *\n+         * The exact product has at most 22 contiguous bits in its\n+         * logical significand. The third number being added in has at\n+         * most 11 contiguous bits in its significand and the lowest\n+         * bit position that could be set is 2^(-24). Therefore, when\n+         * the product has the maximum in-range exponent, 2^15, a\n+         * single double has enough precision to hold down to the\n+         * smallest subnormal bit position, 15 - (-24) + 1 = 40 <\n+         * 53. If the product was large and rounded up, increasing the\n+         * exponent, when the third operand was added, this would\n+         * cause the exponent to go up to 16, which is within the\n+         * range of double, so the product-sum is exact and will be\n+         * correct when rounded to Float16.\n+         *\n+         * 3) Exponent of product is in the range of subnormal values or smaller,\n+         * exponent < Float16.MIN_EXPONENT\n+         *\n+         * The smallest exponent possible in a product is 2^(-48).\n+         * For moderately sized Float16 values added to the product,\n+         * with an exponent of about 4, the sum will not be\n+         * exact. Therefore, an analysis is needed to determine if the\n+         * double-rounding is benign or would lead to a different\n+         * final Float16 result. Double rounding can lead to a\n+         * different result in two cases:\n+         *\n+         * 1) The first rounding from the exact value to the extended\n+         * precision (here `double`) happens to be directed _toward_ 0\n+         * to a value exactly midway between two adjacent working\n+         * precision (here `Float16`) values, followed by a second\n+         * rounding from there which again happens to be directed\n+         * _toward_ 0 to one of these values (the one with lesser\n+         * magnitude).  A single rounding from the exact value to the\n+         * working precision, in contrast, rounds to the value with\n+         * larger magnitude.\n+         *\n+         * 2) Symmetrically, the first rounding to the extended\n+         * precision happens to be directed _away_ from 0 to a value\n+         * exactly midway between two adjacent working precision\n+         * values, followed by a second rounding from there which\n+         * again happens to be directed _away_ from 0 to one of these\n+         * values (the one with larger magnitude).  However, a single\n+         * rounding from the exact value to the working precision\n+         * rounds to the value with lesser magnitude.\n+         *\n+         * If the double rounding occurs in other cases, it is\n+         * innocuous, returning the same value as a single rounding to\n+         * the final format. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that\n+         * the first rounding to double does not occur at the midpoint\n+         * of two adjacent Float16 values:\n+         *\n+         * 1) If a, b and c have the same sign, the sum a*b + c has a\n+         * significand with a large gap of 20 or more 0s between the\n+         * bits of the significand of c to the left (at most 11 bits)\n+         * and those of the product a*b to the right (at most 22\n+         * bits).  The rounding bit for the final working precision of\n+         * `float16` is the leftmost 0 in the gap.\n+         *\n+         *   a) If rounding to `double` is directed toward 0, all the\n+         *   0s in the gap are preserved, thus the `Float16` rounding\n+         *   bit is unaffected and remains 0. This means that the\n+         *   `double` value is _not_ the midpoint of two adjacent\n+         *   `float16` values, so double rounding is harmless.\n+         *\n+         *   b) If rounding to `double` is directed away form 0, the\n+         *   rightmost 0 in the gap might be replaced by a 1, but the\n+         *   others are unaffected, including the `float16` rounding\n+         *   bit. Again, this shows that the `double` value is _not_\n+         *   the midpoint of two adjacent `float16` values, and double\n+         *   rounding is innocuous.\n+         *\n+         * 2) If a, b and c have opposite signs, in the sum a*b + c\n+         * the long gap of 0s above is replaced by a long gap of\n+         * 1s. The `float16` rounding bit is the leftmost 1 in the\n+         * gap, or the second leftmost 1 iff c is a power of 2. In\n+         * both cases, the rounding bit is followed by at least\n+         * another 1.\n+         *\n+         *   a) If rounding to `double` is directed toward 0, the\n+         *   `float16` rounding bit and its follower are preserved and\n+         *   both 1, so the `double` value is _not_ the midpoint of\n+         *   two adjacent `float16` values, and double rounding is\n+         *   harmless.\n+         *\n+         *   b) If rounding to `double` is directed away from 0, the\n+         *   `float16` rounding bit and its follower are either\n+         *   preserved (both 1), or both switch to 0. Either way, the\n+         *   `double` value is again _not_ the midpoint of two\n+         *   adjacent `float16` values, and double rounding is\n+         *   harmless.\n+         *\/\n+\n+        \/\/ product is numerically exact in float before the cast to\n+        \/\/ double;
