Identity\n- * objects have a unique identity determined for them at instance creation time and\n- * preserved throughout their life.\n- *\n- * value objects do *not* have an identity. Instead, they simply aggregate a\n- * set of immutable field values. The lack of identity enables certain performance\n- * optimizations by Java Virtual Machine implementations.\n- * The following operations have special behavior when applied to value\n- * objects:\n- *\n- * - The `==` operator, and the default implementation of the `Object.equals`\n- * method, compare the values of the operands' fields. Value objects\n- * created at different points in a program may be `==`.\n- *\n- * - The `System.identityHashCode` method, and the default implementation of the\n- * `Object.hashCode` method, generate a hash code from the hash codes of a\n- * value object's fields.\n- *\n- * - The `synchronized` modifier and `synchronized` statement always fail when\n- * applied to a value object.\n- *\n- * A value class with an `implicit` constructor may also declare that it tolerates\n- * implicit creation of instances via non-atomic field and array updates.\n- * This means that, in a race condition, new class instances may be accidentally\n- * created by intermixing field values from other instances, without any code\n- * execution or other additional cooperation from the value class. A value class\n- * opts in to allowing this behavior by implementing this interface.\n- *\n- * @since Valhalla\n- *\/\n-\n-public interface LooselyConsistentValue {\n-}\n","filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/lang\/LooselyConsistentValue.java","additions":0,"deletions":65,"binary":false,"changes":65,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -254,1 +254,0 @@\n-    public final Type looselyConsistentValueType;\n@@ -663,1 +662,0 @@\n-        looselyConsistentValueType = enterClass(\"java.lang.LooselyConsistentValue\");\n","filename":"src\/jdk.compiler\/share\/classes\/com\/sun\/tools\/javac\/code\/Symtab.java","additions":0,"deletions":2,"binary":false,"changes":2,"status":"modified"}]}
