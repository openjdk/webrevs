By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n+guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n+software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n+most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n+authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n+covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n+General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n+distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n+that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n+the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n+can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n+you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n+translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n+software, or if you modify it.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n+a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n+make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n+show them these terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n+offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n+and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n+everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n+software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n+know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n+by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n+\n+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n+wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n+individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n+To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n+everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n+follow.\n+\n+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n+placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n+this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n+or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n+derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n+Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n+translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n+without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n+\"you\".\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n+this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n+not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n+constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n+running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n+you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n+appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n+disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n+and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n+Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n+at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n+forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n+or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n+these conditions:\n+\n+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n+    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n+    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n+    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n+    this License.\n+\n+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n+    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n+    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n+    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n+    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n+    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n+    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n+    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n+    not required to print an announcement.)\n+\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n+sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n+considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n+its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n+works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n+work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n+of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n+whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n+rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n+right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n+the Program.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n+Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n+distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n+License.\n+\n+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n+Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n+2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n+    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n+    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n+    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n+    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n+    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n+    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n+    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n+    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n+    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n+    Subsection b above.)\n+\n+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n+modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n+the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n+definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n+of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n+distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n+source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n+of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n+itself accompanies the executable.\n+\n+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n+from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n+code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n+third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n+\n+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n+expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n+sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n+your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n+rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n+long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n+\n+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n+However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n+or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n+accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n+any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n+do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n+the Program or works based on it.\n+\n+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n+the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n+copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n+You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n+rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n+third parties to this License.\n+\n+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n+are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n+contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n+conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n+obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n+For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n+of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n+you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n+particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n+the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n+other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n+section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n+distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n+people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n+distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n+distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n+choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n+consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\n+8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n+countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n+copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n+geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n+distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n+such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n+of this License.\n+\n+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n+General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n+spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n+or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n+version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n+that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n+If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n+choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n+\n+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n+whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n+permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n+write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n+Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n+all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n+software generally.\n+\n+NO WARRANTY\n+\n+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n+THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n+STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n+PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n+INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n+FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n+PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n+YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n+ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n+PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n+GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n+INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n+BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n+FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n+OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n+use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n+which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n+them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n+of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n+pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n+\n+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n+    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n+    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n+    any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n+    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n+    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n+    more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n+starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n+    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n+    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n+    type 'show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n+called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n+\n+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n+if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n+is a sample; alter the names:\n+\n+    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n+    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n+\n+    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n+\n+    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n+\n+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n+License instead of this License.\n+\n+\n+\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n+\n+Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n+subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n+only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n+the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n+exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n+\n+    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n+    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n+    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n+\n+    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n+    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n+    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n+    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n+    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n+    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n+    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n+    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n+    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n+    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n","filename":"LICENSE","additions":347,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":347,"status":"added"}]}
