For example, \"MD2\" is generally no longer considered\n+# to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section describes the mechanism for\n+# disabling algorithms at the JCA\/JCE level based on service name and algorithm\n+# name.\n+#\n+# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the\n+# security property value defined here.\n+#\n+# The syntax of the disabled services string is described as follows:\n+#       \"DisabledService {, DisabledService}\"\n+#\n+#   DisabledService:\n+#       Service.AlgorithmName\n+#\n+# Service:  (one of the following, more services may be added later)\n+#     Cipher | KeyStore | MessageDigest | Signature\n+#\n+#   AlgorithmName:\n+#       (see below)\n+#\n+# The \"AlgorithmName\" is the standard algorithm name of the disabled\n+# service. See the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification\n+# for information about Standard Algorithm Names.  Matching is\n+# performed using a case-insensitive exact matching rule. For Cipher service,\n+# its algorithm is the transformation string.\n+#\n+# Note: If the property value contains entries with invalid syntax or\n+# unsupported services at the time of checking, an ExceptionInInitializerError\n+# with a cause of IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.\n+#\n+# Note: The restriction is applied in the various getInstance(...) methods\n+# of the supported Service classes, i.e. Cipher, KeyStore, MessageDigest,\n+# and Signature. If the algorithm is disabled, a NoSuchAlgorithmException will\n+# be thrown by the getInstance methods of Cipher, MessageDigest, and Signature\n+# and a KeyStoreException by the getInstance methods of KeyStore.\n+#\n+# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.\n+# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.\n+#\n+# Example:\n+#   jdk.crypto.disabledAlgorithms=Cipher.RSA\/ECB\/PKCS1Padding, MessageDigest.MD2\n+#\n+#jdk.crypto.disabledAlgorithms=\n+\n","filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/conf\/security\/java.security","additions":48,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":48,"status":"modified"}]}
