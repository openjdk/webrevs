[{"commit":{"message":"Minor refinements to old-growth heuristics\n\n1. If old-marking finds old-gen is entirely empty, reset the heuristics\n   to initial state, so we can restart the search for appropriate\n   old-gen size\n2. When testing whether old-gen growth \"still\" exceeds the trigger\n   threshold following mixed evacuations, include both old usage and\n   old humongous waste, as that is the quantity that was used for\n   initial trigger."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/heuristics\/shenandoahOldHeuristics.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahOldGeneration.cpp"}],"sha":"0dc8abaa3dce2bce129493cff63619c95979628c"}]
