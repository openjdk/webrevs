In `afterTrial`, the output files are moved to a new path that includes the pid (fork number would be an alternative but it's not as easily available).\n\nAt the moment, results of different runs are not coalesced. But with these changes, it would be easy to coalesce at least the results of the \"collapsed\" output mode.
