This is the set of code required to build\n+and serialize code models. Due to bootstrapping constraints, compiling\n+the compiler it cannot depend on all code in `java.base`.

For now the build has been modified\n+to copy the code, which leverages the script `cr-util\/copy-to-compiler.sh`.\n+If there are issues where code in `java.base` has been modified but is\n+not being copied then doing `make clean-gensrc` should resolve the issue.\n+\n+### Testing\n+\n+Specific compiler tests can be executed using `jtreg`, for example:\n+\n+```\n+jtreg -jdk:.\/build\/macosx-x86_64-server-release\/jdk\/ -ea -esa -avm -va test\/langtools\/tools\/javac\/reflect\/\n+```\n+\n+Specific runtime tests can be executed using `jtreg`, for example:\n+\n+```\n+jtreg -jdk:.\/build\/macosx-x86_64-server-release\/jdk\/ -ea -esa -avm -va test\/jdk\/java\/lang\/reflect\/code\/\n+```\n+\n+In addition, the runtime tests can be executed using make with the test group\n+`jdk_lang_reflect_code` as follows:\n+\n+```\n+make test TEST=jdk_lang_reflect_code\n+```\n\\ No newline at end of file\n","filename":"README.md","additions":36,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":36,"status":"modified"}]}
