It is\n+    a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with\n+    the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the\n+    GPL version 2.\n+\n+    The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all\n+    projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license\n+    compatible to the GPLv2.\n+\n+```\n+\n+### FreeType License\n+```\n+                   The FreeType Project LICENSE\n+                    ----------------------------\n+\n+                            2006-Jan-27\n+\n+                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by\n+          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg\n+\n+\n+\n+Introduction\n+============\n+\n+  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\n+  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\n+  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\n+  FreeType Project.\n+\n+  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\n+  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\n+  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n+  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n+\n+  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n+  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n+  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n+  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n+\n+    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n+      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n+\n+    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n+      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n+\n+    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n+      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n+      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n+      FreeType code. (`credits')\n+\n+  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n+  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n+  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n+  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n+\n+\n+  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n+  credit\/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\n+  encourage you to use the following text:\n+\n+   \"\"\"\n+    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType\n+    Project (www.freetype.org).

However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\n+  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\n+  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\n+  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\n+  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\n+  of this license.\n+\n+4.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n+the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n+\n+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n+rights.\n+\n+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n+distribute and\/or modify the software.\n+\n+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n+authors' reputations.\n+\n+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n+\n+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n+modification follow.\n+\f\n+\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n+\n+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n+under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n+refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n+either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated into another\n+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n+the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n+\n+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n+\n+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n+along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n+\n+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n+\n+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n+    parties under the terms of this License.\n+\n+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n+\f\n+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n+\n+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n+collective works based on the Program.\n+\n+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n+the scope of this License.\n+\n+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n+\n+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n+    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n+\n+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n+    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n+\n+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n+special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n+itself accompanies the executable.\n+\n+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n+\f\n+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n+parties remain in full compliance.\n+\n+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n+the Program or works based on it.\n+\n+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n+this License.\n+\n+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n+\n+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n+circumstances.\n+\n+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n+system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n+impose that choice.\n+\n+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n+be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n+\f\n+  8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in\n+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n+\n+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions\n+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n+address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n+later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n+Foundation.\n+\n+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n+\n+\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n+\n+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES\n+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR\n+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\f\n+\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n+\n+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n+\n+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n+    (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n+    GNU General Public License for more details.\n+\n+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n+\n+\n+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n+\n+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n+when it starts in an interactive mode:\n+\n+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n+\n+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\n+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\n+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n+\n+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n+school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n+\n+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n+\n+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n+  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n+\n+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n+proprietary programs.
