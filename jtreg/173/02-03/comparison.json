The initial handshake between the newly launched process and jtreg\n+can sometimes timeout if the system is under heavy load. This then causes the\n+agent creation to fail. By default, jtreg does not re-attempt creation of the\n+agent VM and instead the failure is propagated as a test action failure and\n+that action gets reported as a failed.\n+\n+This default behaviour can be overridden by passing the `--agent-attempts` option\n+to `jtreg` command. This option takes an integer value which represents the number\n+of attempts jtreg is allowed to make when attempting to get a agent for a test\n+action. By default, the value of this option is `1`, implying jtreg will not\n+re-attempt a failed attempt. Passing a higher value for this option will allow\n+jtreg to re-attempt a failed attempt. For example, a value of `2` will allow jtreg\n+to re-attempt once for each failed attempt.\n+\n","filename":"src\/share\/doc\/javatest\/regtest\/faq.md","additions":18,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":18,"status":"modified"}]}
