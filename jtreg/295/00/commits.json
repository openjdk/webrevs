[{"commit":{"message":"feat: synchronize agent's stdout\/stderr logging\n\nHow it works:\n - The agent vm emits separator text before and after the text.\n - The main vm send the action and waits for the separator text line from\n   the agent vm.\n - After the result have been read by the main vm it expects another separator\n   text line. After consuming the line it redirects output to the agent log.\n\nEdge cases:\n - Timeouts and Agent VM crashes:\n   - The main vm's stdout and stderr tasks will exit due to the\n     closed stream. The main vm is supposed to dispose the failed agent."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/share\/classes\/com\/sun\/javatest\/regtest\/agent\/AgentProcessLogger.java"},{"filename":"src\/share\/classes\/com\/sun\/javatest\/regtest\/agent\/AgentServer.java"},{"filename":"src\/share\/classes\/com\/sun\/javatest\/regtest\/exec\/Agent.java"}],"sha":"49d53afa6727a776d19f2e78fc8c0241f30f86d0"}]
