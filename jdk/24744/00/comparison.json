The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for\n-     building applications, applets, and components that can be\n-     deployed on the Java platform.\n-\n-     The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and\n-     testing programs written in the Java programming language and\n-     running on the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used\n-     from the command line. Except for appletviewer, these tools do not\n-     provide a graphical user interface.\n-\n-\n-Release Notes\n-\n-      See the Release Notes on the Java Software web site for additional \n-      information pertaining to this release. \n- \n-      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/j2se\/1.4.2\/relnotes.html\n-\n-      The on-line release notes will be updated as needed, so you should \n-      check it occasionally for the latest information. \n-\n-\n-Bug Reports and Feedback\n-\n-      The Bug Parade Web Page on the Java Developer Connection(SM) web \n-      site lets you search for and examine existing bug reports, submit \n-      your own bug reports, and tell us which bug fixes matter most to you. \n-\n-      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/jdc\/bugParade\/\n-\n-      To directly submit a bug or request a feature, fill out this form: \n-\n-      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/cgi-bin\/bugreport.cgi \n-\n-      You can also send comments directly to Java Software engineering \n-      team email addresses. \n-\n-      http:\/\/java.sun.com\/mail\/\n-\n-\n-Java 2 SDK Documentation\n-\n-     The on-line Java 2 SDK Documentation contains API specifications,\n-     feature descriptions, developer guides, tool reference pages, demos, \n-     and links to related information. It is located at\n-\n-     http:\/\/java.sun.com\/j2se\/1.4.2\/docs\/\n-\n-     The Java 2 SDK documentation is also available in a download bundle \n-     which you can install locally on your machine. See the \n-     Java 2 SDK download page: \n-     \n-     http:\/\/java.sun.com\/j2se\/1.4.2\/download.html\n-\n-\n-Redistribution\n-\n-      The term \"vendors\" used here refers to licensees, developers, \n-      and independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and \n-      distribute the Java 2 Runtime Environment with their programs. \n-      Vendors must follow the terms of the Java 2 SDK, Standard \n-      Edition, Binary Code License agreement. \n-      Required vs. Optional Files\n-\n-      The files that make up the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, are\n-      divided into two categories: required and optional. Optional \n-      files may be excluded from redistributions of the Java 2 SDK \n-      at the vendor's discretion. The following section contains a \n-      list of the files and directories that may optionally be \n-      omitted from redistributions of the Java 2 SDK. All files not \n-      in these lists of optional files must be included in \n-      redistributions of the Java 2 SDK. \n-\n-      Optional Files and Directories\n-\n-      The following files may be optionally excluded from \n-      redistributions:\n-\n-      jre\/lib\/charsets.jar \n-            Character conversion classes \n-      jre\/lib\/ext\/ \n-            sunjce_provider.jar - the SunJCE provider for Java \n-              Cryptography APIs\n-            localedata.jar - contains many of the resources \n-              needed for non US English locales\n-            ldapsec.jar - contains security features supported \n-              by the LDAP service provider\n-            dnsns.jar - for the InetAddress wrapper of JNDI DNS \n-              provider\n-      bin\/rmid and jre\/bin\/rmid \n-            Java RMI Activation System Daemon \n-      bin\/rmiregistry and jre\/bin\/rmiregistry \n-            Java Remote Object Registry \n-      bin\/tnameserv and jre\/bin\/tnameserv \n-            Java IDL Name Server \n-      bin\/keytool and jre\/bin\/keytool \n-            Key and Certificate Management Tool \n-      bin\/kinit and jre\/bin\/kinit\n-            Used to obtain and cache Kerberos ticket-granting tickets\n-      bin\/klist and jre\/bin\/klist\n-            Kerberos display entries in credentials cache and keytab\n-      bin\/ktab and jre\/bin\/ktab\n-            Kerberos key table manager\n-      bin\/policytool and jre\/bin\/policytool \n-            Policy File Creation and Management Tool \n-      bin\/orbd and jre\/bin\/orbd \n-            Object Request Broker Daemon \n-      bin\/servertool and jre\/bin\/servertool \n-            Java IDL Server Tool \n-      src.zip \n-            Archive of source files \n-\n-      In addition, the Java Web Start product may be excluded from\n-      redistributions. The Java Web Start product is contained in a \n-      file named javaws-1_2-solaris-sparc-i.zip,\n-      javaws-1_2-solaris-i586-i.zip,\n-      javaws-1_2-linux-i586-i.zip, or\n-      javaws-1_2-windows-i586-i.exe, depending on the platform. \n-\n-\n-      Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension\n-\n-      Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the \n-      Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with \n-      the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition and the Java 2 Runtime \n-      Environment allow strong but limited cryptography to be \n-      used.  These files are located at\n-\n-      <java-home>\/lib\/security\/local_policy.jar\n-      <java-home>\/lib\/security\/US_export_policy.jar\n-\n-      where <java-home> is the jre directory of the Java 2 \n-      SDK or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime \n-      Environment.\n-\n-      An unlimited strength version of these files indicating \n-      no restrictions on cryptographic strengths is available \n-      on the Java 2 SDK web site for those living in eligible \n-      countries.  Those living in eligible countries may download \n-      the unlimited strength version and replace the strong \n-      cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.\n-\n-\n-      Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism\n-\n-      An endorsed standard is a Java API defined through a standards\n-      process other than the Java Community Process(SM) (JCP(SM)).\n-      Because endorsed standards are defined outside the JCP, it is\n-      anticipated that such standards will be revised between \n-      releases of the Java 2 Platform. In order to take advantage of \n-      new revisions to endorsed standards, developers and software\n-      vendors may use the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism to\n-      provide newer versions of an endorsed standard than those\n-      included in the Java 2 Platform as released by Sun Microsystems.\n-\n-      For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override\n-      Mechanism, including the list of platform packages that it may \n-      be used to override, see \n-\n-            http:\/\/java.sun.com\/j2se\/1.4.2\/docs\/guide\/standards\/ \n-\n-      Classes in the packages listed on that web page may be replaced\n-      only by classes implementing a more recent version of the API \n-      as defined by the appropriate standards body. \n-\n-      In addition to the packages listed in the document at the above \n-      URL, which are part of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition \n-      (J2SE(TM)) specification, redistributors of Sun's J2SE \n-      Reference Implementation are allowed to override classes whose \n-      sole purpose is to implement the functionality provided by \n-      public APIs defined in these Endorsed Standards packages.  \n-      Redistributors may also override classes in the org.w3c.dom.* \n-      packages, or other classes whose sole purpose is to implement \n-      these APIs. \n-\n-\n-Sun Java Web Pages\n-\n-     For additional information, refer to these Sun Microsystems pages\n-     on the World Wide Web:\n-\n-     http:\/\/java.sun.com\/\n-          The Java Software web site, with the latest information on\n-          Java technology, product information, news, and features.\n-     http:\/\/java.sun.com\/docs\n-          Java Platform Documentation provides access to white papers,\n-          the Java Tutorial and other documents.\n-     http:\/\/java.sun.com\/jdc\n-          The Java Developer Connection(SM) web site.
