[{"commit":{"message":"fixup: don't modify the value in vsrc\n\nFix reduce_mul_integral_gt128b() so it doesn't modify vsrc. With this\nchange, the result of recursive folding is held in vtmp1. To be able to\npass this intermediate result to reduce_mul_integral_le128b(), we would\nhave to use another temporary FloatRegister, as vtmp1 would essentially\nact as vsrc. It's possible to get around this however:\nreduce_mul_integral_le128b() is modified so it's possible to pass\nmatching vsrc and vtmp2 arguments. By doing this, we save ourselves a\ntemporary register in rules that match to reduce_mul_integral_gt128b()."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/c2_MacroAssembler_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"3fc989bd91394aef2cffc84497c31c9ac0c33beb"},{"commit":{"message":"cleanup: revert an unnecessary change to reduce_mul_fp_le128b() formating"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/c2_MacroAssembler_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"ff3a7aad6cf34105d8ee81076f65cb4a6e0caa81"}]
