An alternative would be not printing it at all in this case. Feel free to argue for that solution. Also the printed value for liveness (0.0%) is up for discussion.\n\nTesting: failing test case does not fail any more now and then, gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectionSetCandidates.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.cpp"}],"sha":"3c7b5d9ebed3f54e1c2c8ef85f241acf07cfc145"}]
