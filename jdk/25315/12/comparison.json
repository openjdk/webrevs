RF node keeps\n+ * its referent alive, so the referent's location is recorded at every safepoint (in its oop map) which\n+ * interferes with referent's live range.\n+ *\n+ * It is tempting to directly attach referents to interfering safepoints right from the beginning, but it\n+ * doesn't play well with some optimizations C2 does.\n+ *\n+ * Instead, reachability representation transitions through multiple phases:\n+ *   (0) initial set of RFs is materialized during parsing;\n+ *   (1) optimization pass during loop opts eliminates redundant RF nodes and\n+ *       moves the ones with loop-invariant referents outside loops;\n+ *   (2) after loop opts are over, RF nodes are eliminated and their referents are transferred to\n+ *       safepoint nodes (appended as edges after debug info);\n+ *   (3) during final graph reshaping, referent edges are removed from safepoints and materialized as RF nodes\n+ *       attached to their safepoint node (closely following it in CFG graph).\n+ *\n+ * Some implementation considerations.\n+ *\n+ * (a) It looks attractive to get rid of RF nodes early and transfer to safepoint-attached representation,\n+ * but it is not correct until loop opts are done.\n+ *\n+ * Live ranges of values are routinely extended during loop opts. And it can break the invariant that\n+ * all interfering safepoints contain the referent in their oop map. (If an interfering safepoint doesn't\n+ * keep the referent alive, then it becomes possible for the referent to be prematurely GCed.)\n+ *\n+ * After loop opts are over, it becomes possible to reliably enumerate all interfering safe points and\n+ * ensure the referent present in their oop maps.\n+ *\n+ * (b) RF nodes may interfere with Register Allocator (RA). If a safepoint is pruned during macro expansion,\n+ * it can make some RF nodes redundant, but we don't have information about their relations anymore to detect that.\n+ * Redundant RF node unnecessarily extends referent's live range and increases register pressure.\n+ *\n+ * Hence, we eliminate RF nodes and transfer their referents to corresponding safepoints (phase #2).\n+ * When safepoints are pruned, corresponding reachability edges also go away.\n+ *\n+ * (c) Unfortunately, it's not straightforward to stay with safepoint-attached representation till the very end,\n+ * because information about derived oops is attached to safepoints in a similar way. So, for now RFs are\n+ * rematerialized at safepoints before RA (phase #3).\n+ *\/\n+\n+\/\/ RF is redundant for some referent oop when the referent has another user which keeps it alive across the RF.\n+\/\/ In terms of dominance relation it can be formulated as \"a referent has a user which is dominated by the redundant RF\".\n+\/\/ Until loop opts are over, only RF nodes are considered as usages (controlled by rf_only flag).\n+static bool is_redundant_rf_helper(Node* ctrl, Node* referent, PhaseIdealLoop* phase, PhaseGVN& gvn, bool rf_only) {\n+  const Type* t = gvn.type(referent);\n+  if (!PreserveReachabilityFencesOnConstants && t->singleton()) {\n+    return true;
