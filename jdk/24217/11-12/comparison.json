Appending as a Token works whenever one has a reference\n+            \/\/ to the Object in Java code. But often, this is rather cumbersome and\n+            \/\/ looks awkward, given al the additional quotes and commans required.\n+            \/\/ Optimal would have been Java String Templates, but since those do not\n+            \/\/ currently exist, we use hashtag replacements. These can be either\n+            \/\/ defined by capturing arguments as string names, or by a \"let\" definition,\n+            \/\/ see further down for examples. Which one should be preferred is a code\n+            \/\/ style question. Generally, we prefer the use of hashtag replacements\n+            \/\/ because that allows easy use of multiline strings (i.e. text blocks).\n","filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/testlibrary_tests\/template_framework\/examples\/TestTutorial.java","additions":11,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":11,"status":"modified"}]}
