[{"commit":{"message":"8346954: [JMH] jdk.incubator.vector.MaskedLogicOpts fails due to IndexOutOfBoundsException\n\nSuite MaskedLogicOpts.maskedLogicOperationsLong512() failed on both x86\nand AArch64 with the following error:\n\n```\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 252 out of bounds for length 249\n```\n\nThe variable `long256_arr_idx` is misused when indexing  'LongVector\nl2, l3, l4, l5' in function `maskedLogicOperationsLongKernel()`.\n'long256_arr_idx' increases by 4 every time the benchmark runs and\nensures the incremented value remains within the bounds of the array.\nHowever, for `LongVector.SPECIES_512`, it loads 8 numbers from the\narray each time the benchmark runs, resulting in an out-of-range\nindexing issue.\n\nHence, we revised the index variables from `long256_arr_idx` to\n`long512_arr_idx`, which has a stride of 8, to ensure that the loaded\nvector is inside of the array boundary for all vector species. This is\nalso consistent with other kernel functions.\n\nAdditionally, some defined but unused variables have been removed.\n\nChange-Id: I8a728e6d3c2b54353559294d62cec7005b6552d5"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/micro\/org\/openjdk\/bench\/jdk\/incubator\/vector\/MaskedLogicOpts.java"}],"sha":"083bedec04d5ab78a420e156e74c1257ce30aee8"}]
