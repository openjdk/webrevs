[{"commit":{"message":"* obsolete G1UpdateBufferSize\n\nG1UpdateBufferSize has previously been used to size the refinement\nbuffers and impose a minimum limit on the number of cards per thread\nthat need to be pending before refinement starts.\n\nThe former function is now obsolete with the removal of the dirty\ncard queues, the latter functionality has been taken over by the new\ndiagnostic option `G1PerThreadPendingCardThreshold`.\n\nI prefer to make this a diagnostic option is better than a product option\nbecause it is something that is only necessary for some test cases to\nproduce some otherwise unwanted behavior (continuous refinement).\n\nCSR is pending."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentRefine.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1_globals.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/jvmFlagConstraintsG1.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/jvmFlagConstraintsG1.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/arguments.cpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/runtime\/CommandLine\/OptionsValidation\/TestOptionsWithRanges.java"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/vmTestbase\/gc\/ArrayJuggle\/Juggle2.java"}],"sha":"4d0afd57c6be548c76f6e446e4c4d69cb9b46048"}]
