[{"commit":{"message":"TestEquivalentInvariants: split scenarios that differ by 'AlignVector'\n\nThree variants (3d 3d2 3e) start vectorizing with -XX:-AlignVector, whereas they remain unvectorized under -XX:+AlignVector. Constrain these to AlignVector=false, and add 3 new variants (suffix 'a') with AlignVector=true.\n\nSpecial attention to 3e: it says\n    \/\/ Should never vectorize, since i1 and i2 are not guaranteed to be adjacent\n    \/\/ invar2 + invar3 could overflow, and the address be valid with and without overflow.\n    \/\/ So both addresses are valid, and not adjacent.\nbut now it does vectorize."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/loopopts\/superword\/TestEquivalentInvariants.java"}],"sha":"442e6c85dca7f4d01c39b434050299a69ba8cbe9"}]
