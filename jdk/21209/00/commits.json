[{"commit":{"message":"8341028: Do not use lambdas or method refs for verifyConstantPool\n\nCurrently, `ParserVerifier#verifyConstantPool` uses a `switch` to produce a `Runnable`, which is consumed by a `Consumer<Runnable>` (instantiated within a loop) which runs the task inside if a `try`\/`catch`. We can eliminate a number of lambdas and method references, plus some allocation pressure, in this code by simplifying it so that the `switch` is itself run directly within the `try`\/`catch`."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/jdk\/internal\/classfile\/impl\/verifier\/ParserVerifier.java"}],"sha":"15b03b47fdcaa6484beb8dc209f376b5f7cd0e37"}]
