We can eliminate a number of lambdas and method references, plus some allocation pressure, in this code by simplifying it so that the `switch` is itself run directly within the `try`\/`catch`."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/jdk\/internal\/classfile\/impl\/verifier\/ParserVerifier.java"}],"sha":"f4bcdcc76c97addef5ca46daa075fd38fdb0e0de"}]
