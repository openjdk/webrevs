For ex, if a parent was 100x100px, the child could still claim its size was 200x200px. Now children are constrained to fit inside the parent. Also children now should never overlap."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/BorderLayout.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/java\/awt\/BorderLayout\/ConstrainedBorderLayoutChildrenTest.java"}],"sha":"91e76fb6f30d0946706a0c0b2c9179c52fbbaaa4"},{"commit":{"message":"4811995: adding baseline unit test"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/java\/awt\/BorderLayout\/ConstrainedBorderLayoutChildrenTest.java"}],"sha":"6f23aa81379047d10322f82ecfa23670ee8f7c09"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'master' of https:\/\/github.com\/mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"b9f767ba4014766bc830bd3471e22c30bda5ebce"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'master' of https:\/\/github.com\/mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"86b7944950f449cc2dd64f03d29d0e96efa93e76"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"cc97808bddff1de373fac1ad269f4654bd6dc2cf"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"026c3dbcc06a0d1f31a509953a2cca42b1e840c3"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"93ef96abb3e5fb8712496adec0b865087099d45c"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #5 from openjdk\/master\n\nupdating to openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"81085d416d9ce4ef360ac0bb270a393ee9392d89"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #4 from openjdk\/master\n\nUpdating mickleness\/jdk from openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"69481fc38f4021224ec4a8d1a75b275a89dfa832"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #3 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge from openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"57346a421446d51192ceada277626ba1ae92d8d7"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #2 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"333c87c2107262532815db6978c5e8f59c5a967e"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #1 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge openjdk\/jdk into mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"5dbf0a67ad41a53e03f02c41b1b6364fc3a633ee"}]
