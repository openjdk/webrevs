[{"commit":{"message":"8356061: restructuring to move things to EDT\n\nThis was requested here:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/25244#discussion_r2091656355\n\nmrserb asked: \"Also please move creation and access_to all Swing components to EDT\"\n\n(I'm not sure this will help much? My understanding was *creation* of Swing components could happen off the EDT as long as they were made displayable on the EDT.)\n\nNow we still call jc.getLocationOnScreen off the EDT. If that posed a thread-based problem it'd probably manifest as a IllegalComponentStateException, which is not mentioned in 8356061."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/com\/apple\/laf\/RootPane\/RootPaneDefaultButtonTest.java"}],"sha":"b076c96425c5a0a66f8f25d081b67b6028dc9bd7"},{"commit":{"message":"8356061: adding 1000ms pause after window construction\n\nThis was requested here:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/25244#discussion_r2091656355\n\nSo now we'll pause at least 1.1s before the first call to `jc.getLocationOnScreen`, and at least 2.1s before the first call to `robot.getPixelColor(x, y)`.\n\n(getLocationOnScreen has never failed with an IllegalStateException.)"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/com\/apple\/laf\/RootPane\/RootPaneDefaultButtonTest.java"}],"sha":"9b926904fa0aa3ab44f6b809dbf632760b36ed78"}]
