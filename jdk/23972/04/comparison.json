In other\n+ * words, {@code orElseSet()} guarantees that a stable value's content is <em>set<\/em>\n+ * before it is used.\n+ * <p>\n+ * Furthermore, {@code orElseSet()} guarantees that the supplier provided is\n+ * evaluated only once, even when {@code logger.orElseSet()} is invoked concurrently.\n+ * This property is crucial as evaluation of the supplier may have side effects,\n+ * e.g., the call above to {@code Logger.create()} may result in storage resources\n+ * being prepared.\n+ *\n+ * <h2 id=\"stable-functions\">Stable Functions<\/h2>\n+ * Stable values provide the foundation for higher-level functional abstractions.

Upon such a creation, the dependent {@code Foo} will first be created if\n+ * the {@code Foo} does not already exist.\n+ * <p>\n+ * Here is another example where a more complex dependency graph is created in which\n+ * integers in the Fibonacci delta series are lazily computed:\n+ * {@snippet lang = java:\n+ * public final class Fibonacci {\n+ *\n+ *     private Fibonacci() {}\n+ *\n+ *     private static final int MAX_SIZE_INT = 46;\n+ *\n+ *     private static final IntFunction<Integer> FIB =\n+ *             StableValue.intFunction(MAX_SIZE_INT, Fibonacci::fib);\n+ *\n+ *     public static int fib(int n) {\n+ *         return n < 2\n+ *                 ? n\n+ *                 : FIB.apply(n - 1) + FIB.apply(n - 2);\n+ *     }\n+ *\n+ * }\n+ *}\n+ * Both {@code FIB} and {@code Fibonacci::fib} recurses into each other. Because the\n+ * stable int function {@code FIB} caches intermediate results, the initial\n+ * computational complexity is reduced from exponential to linear compared to a\n+ * traditional non-caching recursive fibonacci method. Once computed, the VM is free to\n+ * constant-fold expressions like {@code Fibonacci.fib(10)}.\n+ * <p>\n+ * The fibonacci example above is a dependency graph with no circular dependencies (i.e.,\n+ * it is a dependency tree). If there are circular dependencies in a dependency graph,\n+ * a stable value will eventually throw a {@linkplain StackOverflowError} upon referencing\n+ * elements in a circularity.\n+ *\n+ * <h2 id=\"thread-safety\">Thread Safety<\/h2>\n+ * The content of a stable value is guaranteed to be set at most once.

Since stable functions and stable collections are built on top of\n+ * {@linkplain StableValue#orElseSet(Supplier) orElseSet()} they too are\n+ * thread safe and guarantee at-most-once-per-input invocation.\n+ *\n+ * <h2 id=\"miscellaneous\">Miscellaneous<\/h2>\n+ * Except for a StableValue's content itself, an {@linkplain #orElse(Object) orElse(other)}\n+ * parameter, and an {@linkplain #equals(Object) equals(obj)} parameter; all method\n+ * parameters must be <em>non-null<\/em> or a {@link NullPointerException} will be thrown.\n+ * <p>\n+ * Stable functions and collections are not {@link Serializable} as this would require\n+ * {@linkplain #list(int, IntFunction) mappers} to be {@link Serializable} as well,\n+ * which would introduce security vulnerabilities.\n+ * <p>\n+ * As objects can be set via stable values but never removed, this can be a source\n+ * of unintended memory leaks. A stable value's content is\n+ * {@linkplain java.lang.ref##reachability strongly reachable}.
