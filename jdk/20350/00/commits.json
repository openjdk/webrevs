[{"commit":{"message":"8337222\n\nHi,\n\n  please review this change that disallows running the `gc\/TestDisableExplicitGC.java` test with `-Xcomp` - code compilation can unnecessarily induce code cache gcs which make the test logic fail (expect no gc at all but there is one). There is no gain running this test with `-Xcomp`.\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/gc\/TestDisableExplicitGC.java"}],"sha":"2b8a729bc70e169976a49ff4a7a8a793fd8bb497"}]
