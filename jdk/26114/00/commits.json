[{"commit":{"message":"8344548: Incorrect StartAggressiveSweepingAt doc for segmented code cache\n\nThe flag StartAggressiveSweepingAt triggers aggressive code cache sweeping based on the percentage of free space in the entire code cache. The previous description referenced segmented vs non-segmented code cache, which is\r\nconfusing and does not reflect the current implementation.\r\n\r\nThis patch updates the flag description to clearly state that the threshold is based on the total code cache free percentage, regardless of segmentation."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/globals.hpp"}],"sha":"698a3f2893fe2f91d6f8e51f8cab1cfe1269e7a9"}]
