[{"commit":{"message":"8364414\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this refactoring of the collection set choosing mechanism to use a lighter data structure: instead of an array of `G1CollectionSetCandidateInfo`s, use an array of `G1HeapRegion*` - we do not use the additional information provided by `G1CollectionSetCandidateInfo' at all during that process, and we copy the contents later anyway.\n\nThis reduces code complexity a bit (no need to extract the `G1HeapRegion*` from the struct) and reduces memory consumption a little as well.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectionSetCandidates.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectionSetCandidates.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectionSetChooser.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectionSetChooser.hpp"}],"sha":"213e156bd72e9704371af33312035f413550f952"}]
