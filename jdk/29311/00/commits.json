[{"commit":{"message":"8375541\n\nHi all,\n\n  during conversion of card table code to use `Atomic<T>` I think I found the following error: the code in `G1BarrierSet::write_ref_field_post` is wrong in that it allows reload of the `_card_table` value, which is exactly what the existing code imo wrongly fails to ensure. even if it does not, making the load explicit improves reading.\n\nTo not let this change get lost in that conversion, and potentially for backport to 26, I factored it out in this change.\n\nThere is no known issue caused by this code in particular, one other bug I'm working on that just looks like what could be caused by this is not fixed.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1BarrierSet.inline.hpp"}],"sha":"f7965b1f2902f109bd7176823cad45ab3e7300a0"}]
