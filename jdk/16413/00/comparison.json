Note that 0s means forever\n+                                  (INTEGER followed by 's' for seconds 'm' for minutes or 'h' for\n+                                  hours, 0s)\n+\n+                 filename         (Optional) Name of the file to which the flight recording data is\n+                                  written when the recording is stopped. If no filename is given, a\n+                                  filename is generated from the PID and the current date and is\n+                                  placed in the directory where the process was started. The\n+                                  filename may also be a directory in which case, the filename is\n+                                  generated from the PID and the current date in the specified\n+                                  directory. (STRING, no default value)\n+\n+                                  Note: If a filename is given, '%%p' in the filename will be\n+                                  replaced by the PID, and '%%t' will be replaced by the time in\n+                                  'yyyy_MM_dd_HH_mm_ss' format.\n+\n+                 maxage           (Optional) Maximum time to keep the recorded data on disk. This\n+                                  parameter is valid only when the disk parameter is set to true.\n+                                  Note 0s means forever. (INTEGER followed by 's' for seconds 'm'\n+                                  for minutes or 'h' for hours, 0s)\n+\n+                 maxsize          (Optional) Maximum size of the data to keep on disk in bytes if\n+                                  one of the following suffixes is not used: 'm' or 'M' for\n+                                  megabytes OR 'g' or 'G' for gigabytes. This parameter is valid\n+                                  only when the disk parameter is set to 'true'. The value must not\n+                                  be less than the value for the maxchunksize parameter set with\n+                                  the JFR.configure command. (STRING, 0 (no max size))\n+\n+                 name             (Optional) Name of the recording. If no name is provided, a name\n+                                  is generated. Make note of the generated name that is shown in\n+                                  the response to the command so that you can use it with other\n+                                  commands. (STRING, system-generated default name)\n+\n+                 path-to-gc-roots (Optional) Flag for saving the path to garbage collection (GC)\n+                                  roots at the end of a recording. The path information is useful\n+                                  for finding memory leaks but collecting it is time consuming.\n+                                  Turn on this flag only when you have an application that you\n+                                  suspect has a memory leak. If the settings parameter is set to\n+                                  'profile', then the information collected includes the stack\n+                                  trace from where the potential leaking object was allocated.\n+                                  (BOOLEAN, false)\n+\n+                 settings         (Optional) Name of the settings file that identifies which events\n+                                  to record. To specify more than one file, use the settings\n+                                  parameter repeatedly. Include the path if the file is not in\n+                                  JAVA-HOME\/lib\/jfr. The following profiles are included with the\n+                                  JDK in the JAVA-HOME\/lib\/jfr directory: 'default.jfc': collects a\n+                                  predefined set of information with low overhead, so it has minimal\n+                                  impact on performance and can be used with recordings that run\n+                                  continuously; 'profile.jfc': Provides more data than the\n+                                  'default.jfc' profile, but with more overhead and impact on\n+                                  performance. Use this configuration for short periods of time\n+                                  when more information is needed.
