[{"commit":{"message":"address review comments: use pd_patch_instruction directly\n\nMacroAssembler::pd_patch_instruction can distinguish between the `b`\nand `movk movz movz br` sequences. Strictly speaking, the method\npatches not a single instruction but a semantically joint sequence of\ninstructions. Use it directly instead of `NativeJump` and\n`NativeGeneralJump` wrapper classes to simplify the implementation and\nget rid of an extra icache invalidation.\n\nOther changes in the patch simply clean up code that became redundant."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/compiledIC_aarch64.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/nativeInst_aarch64.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/cpu\/aarch64\/nativeInst_aarch64.hpp"}],"sha":"7ef1c4aec9531914bfae576e01a85edb7e197f1b"}]
