[{"commit":{"message":"8338751: ConfigureNotify behavior has changed in KWin 6.2\n\nPrior to 6.2, kwin used to always send synthetic ConfigureNotify events\nregardless whether a real ConfigureNotify event is going to be sent. It\nused to do it because of some bugs in GTK2.\n\nIn 6.2, that workaround was dropped (it was needed to fix other issues\nduring interactive resize) so kwin adheres to ICCCM 4.1.5 now.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like JDK relies on kwin always sending synthetic\nconfigure notify events, which is no longer the case.\n\nThis change makes AWT use the TranslateCoordinates request when a real\nConfigureNotify event is received and running kwin as the window manager.\nIt should work as expected even with kwin < 6.2."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/unix\/classes\/sun\/awt\/X11\/XWindowPeer.java"}],"sha":"bb99a6ee819ca55cf0e4404b46a83ba25f311ee6"}]
