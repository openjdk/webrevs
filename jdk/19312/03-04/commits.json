[{"commit":{"message":"JDK-8327650 Test java\/nio\/channels\/DatagramChannel\/StressNativeSignal.java timed out — updates from review feedback: test member variables udpThread and serverSocketThread have been made final, with initialisation from two init methods. Unused read loop in ServerSocketThread run method removed. In the event of an unforeseen return from the accept call, the socket is closed and a RuntimeException is thrown.\nAdditionally, an auxiliary JBS item, JDK-8333526 has been opened to undertake the suggested restructuring of the test to “fail fast” in the event of an impactful Exception being thrown during any stage of the test execution"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/java\/nio\/channels\/DatagramChannel\/StressNativeSignal.java"}],"sha":"5faee21513b33da09c998e4da9d6dc6c215bca3c"}]
