[{"commit":{"message":"8364531\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this refactoring, eliminating some copy&paste, in cset candidate group liveness logging.\n\nThe output is mostly the same, except for the young cset group, where the \"-\" has been replaced to just print the default value (0.0) for efficiency. I did not see this important to have, the gc efficiency for young gen isn't interesting.\n\nTesting: local compilation, gha, visual inspection of output\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.hpp"}],"sha":"66524c8121fd7534d8a2ec5d88ab25d7c3dc4ffa"}]
