Before region pinning,\nG1 would force allocations of new regions beyond the calculated young gen limit while the gclocker\nhad been active.\n\nWith region pinning, this forced allocation is not necessary any more.\n\nTesting: local compilation, gha\n\nHth,\n  Thomas"},"files":[],"sha":"aec808188c12efd9c6020b0310d36e26374f5083"},{"commit":{"message":"8331402\n\nThe is_active() call for the various G1HRPrinter methods is unnecessary as the log_trace() call will do the exact same check again anyway.\n\nHth,\n  Thomas"},"files":[],"sha":"25f24c1a28f9d6772dc321c154ae007b2824aaa0"},{"commit":{"message":"8331401\n\n The HRPrinter does not have any member variables (static or non-static), so it can be made AllStatic.\n\nI.e. there is no reason to have an instance variable around.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nHth,\n  Thomas"},"files":[],"sha":"3e233bf84664692999da6febc136cb503ec335b9"}]
