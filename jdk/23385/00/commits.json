[{"commit":{"message":"8348659: AArch64: IR rule failure with compiler\/loopopts\/superword\/TestSplitPacks.java\n\n\"test5a\" in this file fails on Graviton3 (32B, SVE) as the compiler fails\nto match IR rules for vector size 2. This is because the\nminimum vector size for aarch64 machines is 8B and it does not support\ngeneration of vectors of 2 short values.\n\nModified the IR rules to have two separate rules - one for sse4.1 and\nanother for sve.\n\nThe test now passes on Graviton3."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/loopopts\/superword\/TestSplitPacks.java"}],"sha":"486df1f6df17e1320a436bcf3cc8221b3a05c7d9"}]
