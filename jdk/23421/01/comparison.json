On high order SMP systems it would be better to start with\n-\/\/ a brief global spin and then revert to spinning locally.  In the spirit of MCS\/CLH,\n-\/\/ a contending thread could enqueue itself on the cxq and then spin locally\n-\/\/ on a thread-specific variable such as its ParkEvent._Event flag.\n-\/\/ That's left as an exercise for the reader.  Note that global spinning is\n-\/\/ not problematic on Niagara, as the L2 cache serves the interconnect and\n-\/\/ has both low latency and massive bandwidth.\n+\/\/ algorithm.\n@@ -2522,1 +2519,1 @@\n-  _vthread_cxq_head = OopHandle(JavaThread::thread_oop_storage(), nullptr);\n+  _vthread_list_head = OopHandle(JavaThread::thread_oop_storage(), nullptr);\n@@ -2555,2 +2552,2 @@\n-\/\/   _EntryList = 0x0000000000000000\n-\/\/   _cxq = 0x0000000000000000\n+\/\/   _entry_list = 0x0000000000000000\n+\/\/   _entry_list_tail = 0x0000000000000000\n@@ -2583,2 +2580,2 @@\n-  st->print_cr(\"  _EntryList = \" INTPTR_FORMAT, p2i(_EntryList));\n-  st->print_cr(\"  _cxq = \" INTPTR_FORMAT, p2i(_cxq));\n+  st->print_cr(\"  _entry_list = \" INTPTR_FORMAT, p2i(_entry_list));\n+  st->print_cr(\"  _entry_list_tail = \" INTPTR_FORMAT, p2i(_entry_list_tail));\n","filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/objectMonitor.cpp","additions":327,"deletions":330,"binary":false,"changes":657,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -46,1 +46,1 @@\n-  enum TStates : uint8_t { TS_UNDEF, TS_READY, TS_RUN, TS_WAIT, TS_ENTER, TS_CXQ };\n+  enum TStates : uint8_t { TS_UNDEF, TS_READY, TS_RUN, TS_WAIT, TS_ENTER };\n@@ -75,0 +75,17 @@\n+\n+  ObjectWaiter* const badObjectWaiterPtr = (ObjectWaiter*) 0xBAD;\n+  void set_bad_pointers() {\n+#ifdef ASSERT\n+    this->_prev  = badObjectWaiterPtr;\n+    this->_next  = badObjectWaiterPtr;\n+    this->TState = ObjectWaiter::TS_RUN;\n+#endif\n+  }\n+  ObjectWaiter* next() {\n+    assert (_next != badObjectWaiterPtr, \"corrupted list!\");\n+    return _next;\n+  }\n+  ObjectWaiter* prev() {\n+    assert (_prev != badObjectWaiterPtr, \"corrupted list!\");\n+    return _prev;\n+  }\n@@ -123,1 +140,1 @@\n-\/\/   _recursions, _EntryList, _cxq, and _succ, all of which may be\n+\/\/   _recursions, _entry_list and _succ, all of which may be\n@@ -143,1 +160,1 @@\n-  static OopHandle _vthread_cxq_head;\n+  static OopHandle _vthread_list_head;\n@@ -176,5 +193,4 @@\n-  ObjectWaiter* volatile _EntryList;  \/\/ Threads blocked on entry or reentry.\n-                                      \/\/ The list is actually composed of WaitNodes,\n-                                      \/\/ acting as proxies for Threads.\n-\n-  ObjectWaiter* volatile _cxq;      \/\/ LL of recently-arrived threads blocked on entry.\n+  ObjectWaiter* volatile _entry_list;  \/\/ Threads blocked on entry or reentry.\n+                                       \/\/ The list is actually composed of wait-nodes,\n+                                       \/\/ acting as proxies for Threads.\n+  ObjectWaiter* volatile _entry_list_tail; \/\/ _entry_list is the head, this is the tail.\n@@ -202,1 +218,1 @@\n-  static OopHandle& vthread_cxq_head() { return _vthread_cxq_head; }\n+  static OopHandle& vthread_list_head() { return _vthread_list_head; }\n@@ -248,1 +264,0 @@\n-  static ByteSize cxq_offset()         { return byte_offset_of(ObjectMonitor, _cxq); }\n@@ -250,1 +265,1 @@\n-  static ByteSize EntryList_offset()   { return byte_offset_of(ObjectMonitor, _EntryList); }\n+  static ByteSize entry_list_offset()  { return byte_offset_of(ObjectMonitor, _entry_list); }\n@@ -278,1 +293,1 @@\n-    intptr_t ret_code = intptr_t(_waiters) | intptr_t(_cxq) | intptr_t(_EntryList);\n+    intptr_t ret_code = intptr_t(_waiters) | intptr_t(_entry_list);\n@@ -320,1 +335,1 @@\n-  \/\/ from _cxq\/_EntryList by the current owner when releasing the monitor,\n+  \/\/ from _entry_list by the current owner when releasing the monitor,\n@@ -422,0 +437,1 @@\n+  void      add_to_entry_list(JavaThread* current, ObjectWaiter* node);\n@@ -429,0 +445,1 @@\n+  ObjectWaiter* entry_list_tail(JavaThread* current);\n@@ -438,0 +455,1 @@\n+  bool           try_lock_or_add_to_entry_list(JavaThread* current, ObjectWaiter* node);\n","filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/objectMonitor.hpp","additions":31,"deletions":13,"binary":false,"changes":44,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -369,1 +369,1 @@\n-      \/\/ to the entrylist here and now, avoiding the slow-path.\n+      \/\/ to the entry_list here and now, avoiding the slow-path.\n","filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/synchronizer.cpp","additions":1,"deletions":1,"binary":false,"changes":2,"status":"modified"}]}
