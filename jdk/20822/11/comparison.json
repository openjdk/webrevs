A Network Interface can be physical or virtual.\n+ * A Network Interface has a name, zero or more assigned\n+ * {@linkplain InetAddress IP addresses}, zero or more {@linkplain\n+ * InterfaceAddress MAC Addresses}, and may have an index.\n+ * The name is highly platform specific but a name such as \"le0\"\n+ * is typical; it may not be unique. The index is a highly platform\n+ * specific number that identifies the interface. The network\n+ * configuration may change during the lifetime of the JVM.\n+ * For example, the set of IP addresses assigned to a network\n+ * interface can be transient and dynamically allocated, and may\n+ * change at any time.\n+ * <p>\n+ * When obtaining a {@code NetworkInterface} instance, part of its\n+ * configuration (such as its name and the list of assigned IP addresses),\n+ * is
