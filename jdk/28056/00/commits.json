[{"commit":{"message":"8370682\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this change to fix the inconsistency of survivor regions having a reference to the young gen cardset group, but the cardset group not containing these regions. That also causes some hack in full gc to remove that link separately during GC.\n\nBasically the fix is to avoid adding the survivor regions to the young gen cardset group during gc (where at the end we would remove that link when resetting the young gen cardset), but only add them at the end. Since we already track survivor regions separately during GC for similar purposes, there is no extra complication with that now.\n\nThis is made possible by GC not using the young gen cardset during evacuation for determining the need for remembered set tracking, but uses the region attribute table only (apart from some asserts that are now handled separately).\n\nTesting: gha, tier1-3\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectedHeap.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectionSet.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1FullGCResetMetadataTask.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ParScanThreadState.inline.hpp"}],"sha":"365672c7d517d306fa278682b03e1d1c625467a6"}]
