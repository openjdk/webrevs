[{"commit":{"message":"8365026\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this change that makes G1 start a \"full\" new collection set at initialization time, calling `G1CollectedHeap::start_new_collection_set()`.\n\nPreviously G1 only did part of that (start incremental building only), on a not-fully initialized collection set instance. It works, but is not nice.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectedHeap.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1Policy.cpp"}],"sha":"1eb61f67afa740f9729787359cacf07ba7bc1185"}]
