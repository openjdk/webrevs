[{"commit":{"message":"8361952\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this change that fixes some recently introduced double-checked locking missing the memory barrier (`load_acquire`) on the reader side. Without it the reader might get a valid pointer to the `Mutex` created on the fly, without it being initialized properly.\n\nFound during code inspection for https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8361706 ; due to some suspicious hangs in the `MutexLocker` while cleaning klasses during class unloading in parallel (multiple threads hanging in `MethodData::clean_method_data`), executing the `vmTestbase\/nsk\/jvmti\/RedefineClasses\/StressRedefine\/TestDescription.java` test.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/oops\/methodData.cpp"}],"sha":"cbb690b86bbd6f4950cb0477f9bee3ad4ee7fe7f"}]
