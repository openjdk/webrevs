[{"commit":{"message":"8365939\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this attempt on clearing the young regions cset group early in `abandon_collection_set()` during full gc.\n\nThe initial attempt failed because some verification code depended on the young gen remembered set being `Complete` and contain valid card entries.\n\nThis change fixes both:\n\n- we need to clear the `young_regions_cset_group` with `uninstall_group_cardsets` being `true` to a) remove the cards and b) make it incomplete\n- some verification expects that the young gen remset is always complete, which is not necessary during full gc.\n\nTest: tier1-5, the failing test that caused the failures in JDK-8365780 passes always.\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectedHeap.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1FullCollector.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1HeapVerifier.cpp"}],"sha":"a98f57f988ad71c0c013f5eaed024045f266c65a"}]
