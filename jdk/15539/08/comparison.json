Services filtering is independent of other\n+# mechanisms such as jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms, jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms and\n+# jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms.\n+#\n+# The scope of this filter includes services implemented by statically installed\n+# security providers (security.provider.<n> security properties) and dynamically\n+# installed ones (java.security.Security::addProvider API). No distinctions are\n+# made between OpenJDK and third-party security providers.\n+#\n+# If the system property jdk.security.providers.filter is set, it supersedes\n+# the security one defined here. If any of these properties is set at run time,\n+# the filter could be initialized already and the new value will not take effect\n+# until the JVM is relaunched. When a filter is not set or is set to the empty\n+# string, filtering is disabled: all services are allowed.\n+#\n+# A service is typically evaluated against the filter at provider registration\n+# time (java.security.Provider ::put or ::putService APIs). In special cases, when\n+# a provider overrides java.security.Provider ::getService or ::getServices APIs to\n+# return unregistered services, filter evaluation is deferred until its first use.\n+# Services are identifiable as a combination of a security provider, a service type\n+# and an algorithm name. Optionally, an algorithm alias can be used to replace the\n+# algorithm name. A filter is made of a sequence of patterns that identify a service\n+# according to a matching criteria (as we shall see later) and indicate an action:\n+# allow or deny the service under evaluation.\n+#\n+# The filter syntax is as follows:\n+#\n+# pattern-1; pattern-2; ...; pattern-n\n+#\n+# Each pattern in the sequence can be optionally prefixed by a '!' character (e.g.\n+# \" ! pattern-1 \"). White spaces between patterns, pattern prefixes ('!') and pattern\n+# separators (';') are not significant. A service is evaluated against the filter\n+# from left to right. If a service matches one of the patterns in the sequence, an\n+# authorization decision is made: if the pattern is prefixed by a '!' character, the\n+# decision is to deny it; otherwise, the decision is to allow it. If none of the\n+# patterns match, the default decision is to deny the service. Once a decision is\n+# made, remaining patterns are not considered.\n+#\n+# Each pattern's syntax has one of the following forms:\n+#\n+# 1) security-provider\n+# 2) security-provider.service-type\n+# 3.a) security-provider.service-type.algorithm-name\n+# 3.b) security-provider.service-type.algorithm-alias\n+# 3.c) security-provider.Cipher.transformation\n+# 3.d) security-provider.Cipher.transformation-alias\n+#\n+# In form #1, a security provider name equal to security-provider is enough for a\n+# match to be successful. In form #2, the service type must also be equal to\n+# service-type. In form #3.a, the service algorithm must also be equal to\n+# algorithm-name. In form #3.b, it is enough that one of the service aliases matches\n+# algorithm-alias, in addition to the requirements for form #2. Form #3.c is similar\n+# to form #3.a but applies to cipher transformations with multiple components\n+# (algorithm\/mode\/padding). Form #3.d is equivalent to #3.c but looks for a\n+# transformation alias match (algorithm-alias\/mode\/padding). In all cases, pattern and\n+# service names must have valid characters and cannot be empty. Pattern matching is\n+# always case insensitive.\n+#\n+# Characters '\\n' and '\\0' are not valid in a pattern. The character '.' is used as a\n+# separator between different levels: security provider, service type, algorithm name or\n+# algorithm alias. The following characters, when part of one of the listed levels, must\n+# be escaped by prepending a '\\' character: '!', '*', ' ' (white space), '.', ';', '\\',\n+# ':' and ','. Escaping any other character has no effect other than silently discarding\n+# the '\\' character.\n+#\n+# The aforementioned escaping rules apply to the filter value as read in the\n+# java.security.Security::getProperty and java.lang.System::getProperty APIs:\n+# additional escaping might be needed depending on how the filter value is passed. For\n+# example, security properties require '\\' characters to be escaped. Thus, to match a\n+# provider whose name is abc\\123, a pattern must be escaped as abc\\\\\\\\123 if passed as a\n+# security property.\n+#\n+# In addition to character escape sequences, pattern names can contain '*' wildcards to\n+# imply zero or more repetitions of any character. Wildcards behave in greedy mode, trying\n+# to consume as many characters as possible and backing off if necessary.\n+#\n+# When a service has aliases, its algorithm name and each of the aliases are independently\n+# evaluated against the filter. Notice that the security provider and service type for each\n+# of these evaluations are the same. From the set of authorization decisions obtained —which\n+# can potentially be contradictory—, the one made by the left-most pattern in the filter has\n+# the highest priority and is finally effective. This strategy would be equivalent to\n+# modifying the evaluation of a service against each pattern so that each alias is tried\n+# (besides the algorithm name) and stopping if a decision is made for one of them.\n+#\n+# For troubleshooting, it is possible to enable filter debugging logs with the system\n+# property java.security.debug=jca and look for messages prefixed by ProvidersFilter. To list\n+# services allowed and not allowed by a filter for each installed security provider, run java\n+# with the argument -XshowSettings:security:providers. When a filter value is syntactically\n+# invalid, the exception message thrown points to the exact location in the pattern that could\n+# not be parsed.\n+#\n+# Example\n+#\n+# Enable all services except those involving the algorithms MD2 or MD5:\n+# jdk.security.providers.filter=!*.*.*MD2*; !*.*.*MD5*; *\n+#\n+#jdk.security.providers.filter=\n\\ No newline at end of file\n","filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/conf\/security\/java.security","additions":103,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":103,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -46,0 +46,5 @@\n+grant codeBase \"jrt:\/java.security.sasl\" {\n+    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission\n+                   \"accessClassInPackage.sun.security.jca\";\n+};\n+\n@@ -89,0 +94,2 @@\n+    permission java.lang.RuntimePermission\n+                   \"accessClassInPackage.sun.security.jca\";\n","filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/lib\/security\/default.policy","additions":7,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":7,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -29,1 +29,0 @@\n-import java.util.HashMap;\n@@ -38,1 +37,0 @@\n-import sun.security.action.PutAllAction;\n@@ -72,1 +70,1 @@\n-    private static final HashMap<String, String> MECH_MAP =\n+    private static final Oid[] MECH_OIDS =\n@@ -75,1 +73,1 @@\n-                    public HashMap<String, String> run() {\n+                    public Oid[] run() {\n@@ -121,4 +119,3 @@\n-                                HashMap<String,String> map = new HashMap<>();\n-                                for (int i = 0; i < mechs.length; i++) {\n-                                    if (DEBUG) {\n-                                        debug(\"Native MF for \" + mechs[i]);\n+                                if (DEBUG) {\n+                                    for (Oid mech : mechs) {\n+                                        debug(\"Native MF for \" + mech);\n@@ -126,2 +123,0 @@\n-                                    map.put(\"GssApiMechanism.\" + mechs[i],\n-                                            MF_CLASS);\n@@ -129,1 +124,1 @@\n-                                return map;\n+                                return mechs;\n@@ -144,2 +139,9 @@\n-        if (MECH_MAP != null) {\n-            AccessController.doPrivileged(new PutAllAction(this, MECH_MAP));\n+        if (MECH_OIDS != null) {\n+            final Provider p = this;\n+            AccessController.doPrivileged((PrivilegedAction<Void>) () -> {\n+                for (Oid mech : MECH_OIDS) {\n+                    putService(new Service(p, \"GssApiMechanism\",\n+                            mech.toString(), MF_CLASS, null, null));\n+                }\n+                return null;\n+            });\n","filename":"src\/java.security.jgss\/share\/classes\/sun\/security\/jgss\/wrapper\/SunNativeProvider.java","additions":15,"deletions":13,"binary":false,"changes":28,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -2,1 +2,1 @@\n- * Copyright (c) 1999, 2021, Oracle and\/or its affiliates.
