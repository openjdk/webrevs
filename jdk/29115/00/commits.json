[{"commit":{"message":"8373894\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this change that makes evacuation failed garbage collections count in the gc CPU usage calculations.\n\nThe reason is that currently (since forever), G1 considers garbage collections that experience an evacuation failure to not count in the cpu usage calculations.\n\n(Afair this has been introduced because the previously extremely slow evacuation failures would impact cpu usage based calculations too much even if very infrequent. For many releases evacuation failure handling is at least parallel and in the same order of magnitude wrt to performance).\n\nThis can cause significant distortions in GC behavior.\n\nIn the worst case, if for some reason all garbage collections experience evacuation failure, gc cpu usage (at least for the young gen evacuation pauses) is considered as (close to) zero, with repercussions on heap sizing.\n\nTesting: tier1-5 multiple times to find tests that fail because of the UseGCOverheadLimit flag\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1Policy.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1Policy.hpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/gc\/stress\/TestMultiThreadStressRSet.java"}],"sha":"0f122f87c80fa4f5d13540929f7d1ee6edf01147"}]
