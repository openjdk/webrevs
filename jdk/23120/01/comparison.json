Otherwise, if there is a mismatch of any of these options, the CDS archive may be\n+partially or completely disabled, leading to lower performance.\n+\n+- If the -XX:+AOTClassLoading options *was* used during CDS archive creation, the CDS archive\n+  cannot be used, and the following error message is printed:\n+\n+  `CDS archive has aot-linked classes. It cannot be used when archived full module graph is not used`\n+\n+- If the -XX:+AOTClassLoading options *was not* used during CDS archive creation, the CDS archive\n+  can be used, but the \"archived module graph\" feature will be disabled. This can lead to increased\n+  start-up time.\n+\n+To diagnose problems with the above options, you can add `-Xlog:cds` to the application's VM\n+arguments. For example, if `--add-modules jdk.jconcole` was specified during archive creation\n+and `--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector` is specified during runtime, the following messages will\n+be logged:\n+\n+ `Mismatched values for property jdk.module.addmods`\n+\n+ `runtime jdk.incubator.vector dump time jdk.jconsole`\n+\n+ `subgraph jdk.internal.module.ArchivedBootLayer cannot be used because full module graph is disabled`\n+\n+If any of the VM options `--upgrade-module-path`, `--patch-module` or\n+`--limit-modules` are specified, CDS is disabled.
