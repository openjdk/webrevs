[{"commit":{"message":"8361238\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this fix after the recent changes in void JDK-8274051 where G1 tries to get thread cpu time on already terminated threads.\n\nThe fix is to move the printing\/statistics before stopping the threads. This seems fine for the two implementors of the method.\n\nIn a future change, since so few GCs implement `print_tracing_info`, the call should probably move to `stop()\/begin_exit()`.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/runtime\/java.cpp"}],"sha":"37fa45c96d200b803bbc5cc35b6fb9c25f748bc7"}]
