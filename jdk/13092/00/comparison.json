By design, the {@code Compiler} class does\n- * nothing; it serves as a placeholder for a JIT compiler implementation.\n- * If no compiler is available, these methods do nothing.\n- *\n- * @deprecated JIT compilers and their technologies vary too widely to\n- * be controlled effectively by a standardized interface. As such, many\n- * JIT compiler implementations ignore this interface, and are instead\n- * controllable by implementation-specific mechanisms such as command-line\n- * options. This class is subject to removal in a future version of Java SE.\n- *\n- * @author  Frank Yellin\n- * @since   1.0\n- *\/\n-@Deprecated(since=\"9\", forRemoval=true)\n-public final class Compiler  {\n-    private Compiler() {}               \/\/ don't make instances\n-\n-    \/**\n-     * Compiles the specified class.\n-     *\n-     * @param  clazz\n-     *         A class\n-     *\n-     * @return  {@code true} if the compilation succeeded; {@code false} if the\n-     *          compilation failed or no compiler is available\n-     *\n-     * @throws  NullPointerException\n-     *          If {@code clazz} is {@code null}\n-     *\/\n-    public static boolean compileClass(Class<?> clazz) {\n-        return false;\n-    }\n-\n-    \/**\n-     * Compiles all classes whose name matches the specified string.\n-     *\n-     * @param  string\n-     *         The name of the classes to compile\n-     *\n-     * @return  {@code true} if the compilation succeeded; {@code false} if the\n-     *          compilation failed or no compiler is available\n-     *\n-     * @throws  NullPointerException\n-     *          If {@code string} is {@code null}\n-     *\/\n-    public static boolean compileClasses(String string) {\n-        return false;\n-    }\n-\n-    \/**\n-     * Examines the argument type and its fields and perform some documented\n-     * operation.
