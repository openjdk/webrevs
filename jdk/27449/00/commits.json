[{"commit":{"message":"8367391: Loss of precision on implicit conversion in vectornode.cpp\n\nThere is an issue with fix against JDK-8356760 on windows-x64 related to\nfollowing lines\n```\n  long mask = (-1ULL >> (64 - vlen));\n  long bit  = type->get_con() & mask;\n```\n\n`-1ULL` is an unsigned **64-bit** value; on Linux\/macOS-x64, `long` is\n**64** bits, but on Windows-x64 itâ€™s **32** bits. When assigning `-1ULL >> (64 - vlen)`\nto a `long` on Windows-x64, the **64-bit** result is truncated to **32**\nbits, causing precision loss as the upper 32 bits are discarded.\n\nThis pull request addresses the issue by replacing the `long` type with `jlong`.\nThe fix has been verified on a Windows x64 machine with avx-512 support and resolves the\nreported problem."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/vectornode.cpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/VectorMaskFromLongTest.java"}],"sha":"67bc7f4c2bcc7df4cceee3b485f142124c72f9d2"}]
