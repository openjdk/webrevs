Throw OOM after failed allocation request following a Full GC (rather\n   than retrying as long as Full GC makes good progres because\n   repeatedly retrying the allocation request creates brown-out behavior\n   with no identified benefits on real-world workloads)\n\n2. Count a successful allocation following a blocking\n   handle_allocation_failure() request to be good GC progress.\n   Otherwise, we increment gc_no_progress_count in full GCs that\n   have bad progress, but successful allocations, and this causes\n   unwanted failure to even try a full GC in a different thread after\n   an out-of-memory condition might have been resolved in this thread.\n\n3. Count a completed concurrent GC cycle as good progress, regardless\n   of how much memory it might have been able to reclaim.  The fact that\n   concurrent GC succeeded without allocation failure and without\n   degeneration is considered good progress.  Successful concurrent\n   GCs between Full GCs will reset the gc_no_progress_count to zero.\n\n4. Do not count degenerated cycles as having no-progress.  If a\n   degenerated cycle has no progress, it will upgrade to full GC.\n   The upgraded full GC will evaluate its own progress.  We don't\n   want to count this \"same [upgraded] cycle\" twice."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahControlThread.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahDegeneratedGC.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahHeap.cpp"}],"sha":"439d394cab24ea9577550d3e44bbb02c1486dba8"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"045590b2e92947711372d676a58ac1d24431168e"},{"commit":{"message":"Revert \"Make GC logging less verbose\"\n\nThis reverts commit 3a67b1f5fb66abdfdef53cb6346c7a7f1c67d843."},"files":[],"sha":"3692312a928439fc7f6dae5f4a22b75186ef8525"},{"commit":{"message":"Make GC logging less verbose"},"files":[],"sha":"3a67b1f5fb66abdfdef53cb6346c7a7f1c67d843"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"981692e7af17a22964f38186aae49d25b4386c7c"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"4126c22828d51a92b8a8242b12a233a72225c173"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"9a1989dfc13bd49d3a099096d503146ae847b919"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"46ad5c6e47b732a51441f36adc436b7020244b20"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"2e224f688c8fe7cb91baa4b8cc74d0561ceed9af"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"7fe605f12588396e542f74f6155d05218a69e2a4"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"4d6b5cd7b5355d1baebd981826803dac68cd4204"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"f215a704990f7526ff96d1f69848f507ed963191"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"41ba86a0dfb42e597b6cf8fbff23fb47fb48a43f"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"c4c252ed113363653e79edf697885c1035986e33"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"dafc3632766ca5a268d88c742f416da29cecdea9"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"441487cb21afea312628e254b44628446cca5423"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"ba98e42d791202373d10c433c39e0a9ed6adb1d8"},{"commit":{"message":"Revert \"Improve documentation of how Evac-OOM Protocol works\"\n\nThis reverts commit 702710eba324e2117e7f3e10ab073e307ab3303e."},"files":[],"sha":"51d056f8e6d2549ba8bc0435bc86b2c5243dce52"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"61b575f951eaa49c89f6cbd44772ab4f33f8126a"},{"commit":{"message":"Improve documentation of how Evac-OOM Protocol works"},"files":[],"sha":"702710eba324e2117e7f3e10ab073e307ab3303e"}]
