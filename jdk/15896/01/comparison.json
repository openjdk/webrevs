As a result, there are no copies involved\n+ * when inserting objects into the list or referencing list objects,\n+ * and removing an object from a list need not involve destroying the\n+ * object.\n+ *\n+ * To be used in a IntrusiveList, an object must have a\n+ * IntrusiveListEntry member.  An IntrusiveList is associated with the\n+ * class of its elements and the entry member.\n+ *\n+ * An object can be in multiple lists at the same time, so long as\n+ * each list uses a different entry member.  That is, the class of the\n+ * object must have multiple IntrusiveListEntry members, one for each\n+ * list the object is simultaneously an element.\n+ *\n+ * The API for IntrusiveList is modelled on the containers provided by\n+ * the C++ standard library.  In particular, iteration over the\n+ * elements is provided via iterator classes.\n+ *\n+ * IntrusiveLists support polymorphic elements.  Because the objects\n+ * in a list are externally managed, rather than being embedded values\n+ * in the list, the actual type of such objects may be more specific\n+ * than the list's element type.\n+ *\n+ * * T is the class of the elements in the list.  Must be a possibly\n+ * const-qualified class type.\n+ *\n+ * * entry_member is a pointer to class member referring to the\n+ * IntrusiveListEntry subobject of T used by this list.\n+ *\n+ * * has_size determines whether the list has a size()\n+ * operation, returning the number of elements in the list.  If the\n+ * operation is present, it has constant-time complexity.  The default\n+ * is to not provide a constant-time size() operation.\n+ *\n+ * * Base is the base class for the list.  This is typically\n+ * used to specify the allocation class.  The default is void, indicating\n+ * no allocation class for the list.\n+ *\n+ * The value type for a list may be const-qualified.  Such a list provides\n+ * const iterators and access to const-qualified elements.  A list whose value\n+ * type is not const-qualified can provide both const and non-const iterators\n+ * and can provide access to either const or unqualified elements, depending\n+ * on the operation used.  A list that is itself const only provides const\n+ * iterators and access to const-qualified elements.  A const object cannot be\n+ * added to a list whose value type is not const-qualified, as that would be\n+ * an implicit casting away of the const qualifier.\n+ *\n+ * Some operations that remove elements from a list take a disposer argument.\n+ * This is a function or function object that will be called with one\n+ * argument, a const reference to a removed element.  This function should\n+ * \"dispose\" of the argument object when called, such as by deleting the\n+ * object.  The result of the call is ignored.\n+ *\n+ * Usage of IntrusiveList involves defining an element class which\n+ * contains a IntrusiveListEntry member, and using a corresponding\n+ * specialization of the IntrusiveList class, e.g.\n+ *\n+ * <code>\n+ * class MyClass {\n+ * public:\n+ *   ...\n+ *   IntrusiveListEntry _entry;\n+ *   ...\n+ * };\n+ *\n+ *   ...\n+ *   IntrusiveList<MyClass, &MyClass::_entry> mylist;\n+ *   ... use mylist ...\n+ * <\/code>\n+ *\n+ * Alternatively, the scope of the entry member can be limited, with a\n+ * type alias of a list specialization providing access, e.g.\n+ *\n+ * <code>\n+ * class MyClass {\n+ *   ...\n+ *   IntrusiveListEntry _entry;\n+ *   ...\n+ * public:\n+ *   ...\n+ *   using MyList = IntrusiveList<MyClass, &MyClass::_entry>;\n+ *   ...\n+ * };\n+ *\n+ *   ...\n+ *   MyClass::MyList mylist;\n+ *   ... use mylist ...\n+ * <\/code>\n+ *\/\n+template<typename T,\n+         IntrusiveListEntry T::*entry_member,\n+         bool has_size = false,\n+         typename Base = void>\n+class IntrusiveList;\n+\n+\/**\n+ * A class with an IntrusiveListEntry member can be used as an element\n+ * of a corresponding specialization of IntrusiveList.\n+ *\/\n+class IntrusiveListEntry {\n+  friend class IntrusiveListImpl;\n+\n+public:\n+  \/** Make an entry not attached to any list. *\/\n+  IntrusiveListEntry()\n+    : _prev(nullptr),\n+      _next(nullptr)\n+      DEBUG_ONLY(COMMA _list(nullptr))\n+   {}\n+\n+  \/**\n+   * Destroy the entry.\n+   *\n+   * precondition: not an element of a list.\n+   *\/\n+  ~IntrusiveListEntry() NOT_DEBUG(= default);\n+\n+  NONCOPYABLE(IntrusiveListEntry);\n+\n+private:\n+  \/\/ _prev and _next are the links between elements \/ root entries in\n+  \/\/ an associated list.

The encoded void* provides a discriminated\n+\/\/ union of the following:\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ - T*: a pointer to a list element.\n+\/\/ - IntrusiveListEntry*: a pointer to a list's root entry.\n+\/\/ - nullptr: a pointer to no object.\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ IntrusiveListEntry uses such encoded values to refer to the next or\n+\/\/ previous object in a list, e.g. to represent the links between\n+\/\/ objects.\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ IteratorImpl uses such encoded values to refer to the object that\n+\/\/ represents the iterator.  A singular iterator is represented by an\n+\/\/ encoded null.  A dereferenceable iterator is represented by an\n+\/\/ encoded pointer to a list element.  An encoded list root entry is\n+\/\/ used to represent either an end-of-list or before-the-beginning\n+\/\/ iterator, depending on context.\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ The encoding of these values uses a tagged void pointer scheme.\n+\/\/ null represents itself.  A list element (T*) is distinguished from\n+\/\/ a IntrusiveListEntry* via the low address bit.  If the low bit is\n+\/\/ set, the value is a IntrusiveListEntry*; specifically, it is one\n+\/\/ byte past the pointer to the entry.  Otherwise, it is a list\n+\/\/ element.  [This requires all value types and IntrusiveListEntry to\n+\/\/ have an alignment of at least 2.]\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ This encoding leads to minimal cost for typical correct iteration patterns.\n+\/\/ Dereferencing an iterator referring to a list element consists of just\n+\/\/ reinterpreting the type of the iterator's internal value.  And for\n+\/\/ iteration over a range denoted by a pair of iterators, until the iteration\n+\/\/ reaches the end of the range the current iterator always refers to a list\n+\/\/ element.  Similarly, incrementing an iterator consists of just a load from\n+\/\/ the iterator's internal value plus a constant offset.\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ IteratorOperations also provides a suite of operations for\n+\/\/ manipulating iterators and list elements, making use of that\n+\/\/ encoding.  This allows the implementation of iterators and lists to\n+\/\/ be written in terms of these higher level operations, without\n+\/\/ needing to deal with the underlying encoding directly.\n+\/\/\n+\/\/ Note that various functions provided by this class take a const_reference\n+\/\/ argument.  This means some of these functions may break the rule against\n+\/\/ putting const elements in lists with non-const elements.  It is up to\n+\/\/ callers to ensure that doesn't really happen and result in implicitly\n+\/\/ casting away const of the passed argument.  That is, if the list has\n+\/\/ non-const elements then the actual argument must be non-const, even though\n+\/\/ the function parameter is const_reference.  We do it this way because\n+\/\/ having the overloads for both, with one being conditional, would\n+\/\/ significantly expand the code surface and complexity here.
