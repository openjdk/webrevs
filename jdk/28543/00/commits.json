[{"commit":{"message":"8372684\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this change that changes some volatile atomics to the new `Atomic` construct, fixing some issue with missing load_acquire when allocating in `G1HeapRegion::par_allocate()`.\n\nThat `load_acquire` seems necessary as when setting a new allocation region, there needs to be synchronization about the contents (top\/end) of the heap region. Otherwise the allocating thread might get old\/previous top values sent from the corresponding storestore (I changed to a `release_store()` in `G1AllocRegion::update_alloc_region()`.\n\nSimilar issue exists in the handling of the retained regions.\n\nI also made the `G1AllocatorRegion::_dummy_region` Atomic; synchronization is necessary for a single `release_store` at initialization. No further synchronization is necessary (just using relaxed loads) as its contents are never changed afterwards.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1AllocRegion.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1AllocRegion.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1AllocRegion.inline.hpp"}],"sha":"63d623bab690cb4ae862d3d2e6c04ef2359bb20b"}]
