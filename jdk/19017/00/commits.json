[{"commit":{"message":"8331398\n\n   Currently, the various reclamation events always print FREE as the region type in the event string because the methods are always called after freeing.\n\nThis is kind of useless information (obviously reclaimed regions are FREE after reclaiming), so this CR suggests to use the original type to understand what region has been reclaimed.\n\nTesting: local compilation, local testing\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1YoungGCPostEvacuateTasks.cpp"}],"sha":"054cad689d9e825e583cb028374008d9b8261ea1"}]
