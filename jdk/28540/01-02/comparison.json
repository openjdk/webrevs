The effort to make final mean final, that all illegal final field\n-modifications must use `--enable-final-field-mutation` and `--add-opens`,\n-represents a step toward this goal.\n-\n-In JEP 500, when `--illegal-final-field-mutation=deny`, a final field `f` is\n-still mutable if for some module `M` (including the unnamed module) that could\n-perform final field mutation, one of the following stands:\n-\n-1. `f` is a public field declared in a public class, and the package\n-   of the declaring class is exported by the containing module to `M`.\n-2. The package of the declaring class of `f` is open to `M`.\n-3. `f` is in `M`.\n-\n-This set of rules is more complex than the existing logic in `fieldDescriptor`,\n-and being in `jdk.internal.module.ModuleBootstrap`, is not easy to export to\n-the JVM runtime.  In addition, the performance implication of enabling final\n-field mutation on the command line may also be concerning to users.\n-\n-In conclusion, trusting based on final field mutation settings is possible, but\n-whether the cost is worth the return is under investigation.\n","filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/jdk\/internal\/vm\/annotation\/constant-folding.md","additions":1,"deletions":25,"binary":false,"changes":26,"status":"modified"}]}
