[{"commit":{"message":"8361140: Missing OptimizePtrCompare check in ConnectionGraph::reduce_phi_on_cmp\n\nWhen running with `-XX:-OptimizePtrCompare` (which disables pointer comparison optimization), the compiler may hit an assertion failure in debug builds because `optimize_ptr_compare` is still being called. This violates the intended usage of the flag and leads to unexpected crashes.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an early return to `reduce_phi_on_cmp` when `OptimizePtrCompare` is false. Since the optimization relies on `optimize_ptr_compare` for static reasoning about comparisons, there's no benefit in proceeding with `reduce_phi_on_cmp` when this support is disabled."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/opto\/escape.cpp"}],"sha":"f118400dc906112a8010c7d425c186a1afe981be"}]
