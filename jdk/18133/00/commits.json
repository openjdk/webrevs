[{"commit":{"message":"8327238\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this trivial removal of the `MetadataFailAlot` flags; one of them,\n`MetadataAllocationFailALotInterval` is unused anyway, and the other\n`MetadataAllocationFailALot` only prevents the attempt to retry metadata allocation\nin the VM operation.\n\nThis functionality does not seem to stress metadata allocation failure at all, just\nexecution of the metadata VM operation, so I decided to just drop the second flag\nas well.\n\nI considered keeping it maybe as `MetadataAllocationFailRetry` or something, but\ndecided against it since it does not seem interesting to test. However I can at\nreviewer's request do that.\n\nTesting: local compilation, gha, grepping hotspot tests\/hotspot sources\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shared\/gcVMOperations.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shared\/gc_globals.hpp"}],"sha":"c6534a73eb58f9bb439605d2763cd7e8fb88a133"}]
