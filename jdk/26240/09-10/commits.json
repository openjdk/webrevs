[{"commit":{"message":"Address Thomas Schatzl's review comments for JDK-8357445\n\nThis commit addresses all issues raised in Thomas's November 2025 review\nof the time-based heap uncommit feature (PR #26240).\n\nMajor architectural fix:\n- VM_G1ShrinkHeap::doit() now re-evaluates uncommit candidates at safepoint\n  time by calling find_uncommit_candidates_by_time() during VM operation\n  execution. This ensures regions are validated as still free at the point\n  of uncommit, fixing the race condition where heap state could change\n  between service thread evaluation and VM operation execution.\n\nCode quality improvements:\n- Removed redundant is_empty() checks in g1HeapSizingPolicy.cpp and\n  g1HeapRegionManager.cpp since is_free() already implies empty\n- Replaced inefficient bubble sort with GrowableArray::sort() using\n  lambda comparator for O(n log n) performance\n- Fixed lambda signature (G1HeapRegion** instead of const*) to match\n  GrowableArray::sort() requirements\n- Added periods to sentence-style comments for consistency\n\nThe implementation already had correct:\n- SuspendibleThreadSetJoiner placement in service thread task\n- GC coordination with 5% overhead threshold and G1ReservePercent\n- Proper assertions and validations\n\nTested with SPECjbb2015 showing correct time-based region selection\nand uncommit behavior across varying load patterns."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1CollectedHeap.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1HeapEvaluationTask.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1HeapRegionManager.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1HeapSizingPolicy.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1VMOperations.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1VMOperations.hpp"}],"sha":"cc7a779ab6ebbed8f533ef912408d5e06e909880"}]
