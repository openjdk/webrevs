[{"commit":{"message":"8352147\n\nHi all,\n\n  please review this refactor of the TestEagerReclaimHumongousRegionsClearMarkBits test that runs way too long, and sometimes even causing timeouts in GHA.\n\nSo the problem is that TestEagerReclaimHumongousRegionsClearMarkBits checks whether after eager reclaim during marking the mark on the humongous object is cleared correctly. It does so with a trial-and-error approach allocating humongous objects and hoping that the faulty state somehow occurs.\n\nThis can take a long time, and although the test limits itself to 50s runtime, for some reason there can still be sporadic timeouts in some setups.\n\nHowever for a long time it is possible to halt concurrent mark just before completion, inducing the exact state needed for this test. So rewrite the test to be more targeted.\n\nTesting: gha, running test locally\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas\n\n* also check for actual region reclamation\n* last minute typo"},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/gc\/g1\/TestEagerReclaimHumongousRegionsClearMarkBits.java"}],"sha":"86aa8495cc73437dba5c946dbbea2880fdef40e0"}]
