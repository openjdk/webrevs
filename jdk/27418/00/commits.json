[{"commit":{"message":"8368205: [TESTBUG] VectorMaskCompareNotTest.java crashes when MaxVectorSize=8\n\nThe VectorShape size of `I_SPECIES_FOR_CAST` declared in test **VectorMaskCompareNotTest.java**\nis half that of `L_SPECIES_FOR_CAST`. And `L_SPECIES_FOR_CAST` is created with the maximum shape.\nTherefore, if `MaxVectorSize` is set to 8, the shape size of `I_SPECIES_FOR_CAST` is 4, which\nis an illegal value because the minimum vector size requirement is 8 bytes.\n\nThis pull request addresses the issue by ensuring that this test runs only when `MaxVectorSize`\n is set to 16 bytes or higher."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/vectorapi\/VectorMaskCompareNotTest.java"}],"sha":"2818a686c6013217c0eedd623bac38929ae457cb"}]
