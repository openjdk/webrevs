[{"commit":{"message":"Take regulator thread out of STS before requesting GC\n\nThe request may block while it waits for control thread to stop old marking. If workers are already in the STS, and the regulator thread is still in the STS, but cannot yield, the safepoint will not run. Control, worker and regulator threads deadlock each other."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/shenandoah\/shenandoahRegulatorThread.cpp"}],"sha":"e416d123d622a599550a11a84550f59a44e21177"}]
