Restricted methods\n-are typically used to bind native foreign data and\/or functions to first-class\n-Java API elements which can then be used directly by clients. For instance the\n-restricted method <a href=\"..\/MemorySegment.html#reinterpret(long)\"><code>MemorySegment.reinterpret(long)<\/code><\/a>\n-can be used to create a fresh segment with the same address and temporal bounds, but with\n-the provided size. This can be useful to resize memory segments obtained when\n-interacting with native functions.\n-<p>\n-    Binding foreign data and\/or functions is generally unsafe and, if done incorrectly,\n-    can result in VM crashes, or memory corruption when the bound Java API element\n-    is accessed. For instance, incorrectly resizing a native memory segment using\n-    <a href=\"..\/MemorySegment.html#reinterpret(long)\"><code>MemorySegment.reinterpret(long)<\/code><\/a>\n-    can lead to a JVM crash, or, worse, lead to silent memory corruption when attempting to\n-    access the resized segment. For these reasons, it is crucial for code that calls\n-    a restricted method to never pass arguments that might cause incorrect binding\n-    of foreign data and\/or functions to a Java API.\n-<\/p>\n-<p>\n-    Given the potential danger of restricted methods, the Java runtime issues a warning on\n-    the standard error stream every time a restricted method is invoked. Such warnings can\n-    be disabled by granting access to restricted methods to selected modules.
