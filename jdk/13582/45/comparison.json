With compact object\n+ * headers, we store the compressed class pointer in the header, which would be overwritten by full forwarding\n+ * pointer, if we allow the legacy forwarding code to act. This would lose the class information for the object,\n+ * which is required later in GC cycle to iterate the reference fields and get the object size for copying.\n+ *\n+ * SlidingForwarding requires only small side tables and guarantees constant-time access and modification.\n+ *\n+ * The idea is to use a pointer compression scheme very similar to the one that is used for compressed oops.\n+ * We divide the heap into number of logical regions. Each region spans maximum of 2^NUM_OFFSET_BITS words.\n+ *\n+ * The key advantage of sliding compaction for encoding efficiency: it can forward objects from one region to a\n+ * maximum of two regions. This is an intuitive property: when we slide the compact region full of data, it can\n+ * only span two adjacent regions. This property allows us to use the off-side table to record the addresses of\n+ * two target regions. The table holds N*2 entries for N logical regions. For each region, it gives the base\n+ * address of the two target regions, or a special placeholder if not used. A single bit in forwarding would\n+ * indicate to which of the two \"to\" regions the object is forwarded into.\n+ *\n+ * This encoding efficiency allows to store the forwarding information in the object header _together_ with the\n+ * compressed class pointer.\n+ *\n+ * When recording the sliding forwarding, the mark word would look roughly like this:\n+ *\n+ *   64                              32                                0\n+ *    [................................OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAFTT]\n+ *                                                                    ^----- normal lock bits, would record \"object is forwarded\"\n+ *                                                                  ^------- fallback bit (explained below)\n+ *                                                                 ^-------- alternate region select\n+ *                                     ^------------------------------------ in-region offset\n+ *     ^-------------------------------------------------------------------- protected area, *not touched* by this code, useful for\n+ *                                                                           compressed class pointer with compact object headers\n+ *\n+ * Adding a forwarding then generally works as follows:\n+ *   1. Compute the \"to\" offset in the \"to\" region, this gives \"offset\".\n+ *   2. Check if the primary \"from\" offset at base table contains \"to\" region base, use it.\n+ *      If not usable, continue to next step. If usable, set \"alternate\" = \"false\" and jump to (4).\n+ *   3. Check if the alternate \"from\" offset at base table contains \"to\" region base, use it.\n+ *      This gives us \"alternate\" = \"true\". This should always complete for sliding forwarding.\n+ *   4. Compute the mark word from \"offset\" and \"alternate\", write it out\n+ *\n+ * Similarly, looking up the target address, given an original object address generally works as follows:\n+ *   1. Load the mark from object, and decode \"offset\" and \"alternate\" from there\n+ *   2. Compute the \"from\" base offset from the object\n+ *   3. Look up \"to\" region base from the base table either at primary or alternate indices, using \"alternate\" flag\n+ *   4. Compute the \"to\" address from \"to\" region base and \"offset\"\n+ *\n+ * This algorithm is broken by G1 last-ditch serial compaction: there, object from a single region can be\n+ * forwarded to multiple, more than two regions. To deal with that, we initialize a fallback-hashtable for\n+ * storing those extra forwardings, and set another bit in the header to indicate that the forwardee is not\n+ * encoded but should be looked-up in the hashtable. G1 serial compaction is not very common - it is the\n+ * last-last-ditch GC that is used when the JVM is scrambling to squeeze more space out of the heap, and at\n+ * that point, ultimate performance is no longer the main concern.\n+ *\/\n+class SlidingForwarding : public AllStatic {\n+private:\n+\n+  \/*\n+   * A simple hash-table that acts as fallback for the sliding forwarding.\n+   * This is used in the case of G1 serial compaction, which violates the\n+   * assumption of sliding forwarding that each object of any region is only\n+   * ever forwarded to one of two target regions.
