[{"commit":{"message":"Align behaviour with the CSR\n\nMake a PKCS #11 library supporting only CKM_HKDF_DERIVE or CKM_HKDF_DATA\nto also register the HKDF algorithms. Notice that the corresponding HMAC\nmechanism is still required. In case only one of the mechanisms is\navailable, KDF::deriveKey or KDF::deriveData will fail at run time.\n\nIf the user disables one of CKM_HKDF_DERIVE or CKM_HKDF_DATA through\nsun.security.pkcs11.Config, also refrain from using it.\n\nCo-authored-by: Martin Balao Alonso <mbalao@redhat.com>\nCo-authored-by: Francisco Ferrari Bihurriet <fferrari@redhat.com>"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/jdk.crypto.cryptoki\/share\/classes\/sun\/security\/pkcs11\/P11HKDF.java"},{"filename":"src\/jdk.crypto.cryptoki\/share\/classes\/sun\/security\/pkcs11\/P11SecretKeyFactory.java"},{"filename":"src\/jdk.crypto.cryptoki\/share\/classes\/sun\/security\/pkcs11\/SunPKCS11.java"}],"sha":"87f4820aac1b1f96a3fe3155e90057a3c1544ce7"}]
