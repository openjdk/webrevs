[{"commit":{"message":"8336912\n\nHello,\n\n  please review this change to workaround an unintentional division by zero found by ubsan.\n\nThe global option `G1ConfidencePercent` allowed zero as confidence for predictions which this change simply disallows: not sure what the response of the VM could be if the user told it that it should have absolutely no confidence in the predictions (not \"very low\" confidence).\n\nTesting: after this change, the ubsan failure goes away.\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1_globals.hpp"},{"filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/gc\/arguments\/TestG1PercentageOptions.java"}],"sha":"017814019e424063646bfd1beac401dbdfdbe74f"}]
