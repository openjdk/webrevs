[{"commit":{"message":"fixup! Reader.of(String)\n\nUpdated JavaDocs according to Alan Bateman's review comments:\n* Dropped \"API compatible with StringReader\" from description\n* @apiNote in StringReader refers to static factory method\n* Dropped \"lock\" field from API docs\n* Added \"The resulting Reader is not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. If the Reader is to be used by more than one thread it should be controlled by appropriate synchronization\"\n* Deviating from your proposal, I renamed parameter \"c\" to \"source\" for clarity as the name \"cs\" already exists as an internal variable\n* Method specifies NPE for `of(null)` case\n\nI addition, JavaDocs now says \"reader\", not \"stream\" anymore."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/io\/Reader.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/classes\/java\/io\/StringReader.java"}],"sha":"7b83e4077be7a4248a50261fe0505867f255920e"}]
