The reasoning is similar\nto zgc (and the new costs as well): only the part of the barrier inlined\ninto the main code stream, as the slow path is laid out separately and\ndoes\/should not directly affect performance (particularly if there is no\nmarking going on).\n\nThere are no differences\/impact in performance since the post barrier cost\nis still very large, which fill be fixed elsewhere.\n\nTesting: gha, perf testing standalone (neither micros nor actual\nbenchmarks give any difference outside of variance), testing with JDK-8342382\n\nHth,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/c2\/g1BarrierSetC2.cpp"}],"sha":"429bc01b6bd5f5dbf91559e9ce3b0a09279a384e"}]
