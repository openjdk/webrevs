That's why slowdebug build can pass.\n\nNote-3: To be honest, I didn't fully understand why this warning is\nraised by GCC 12 and 13. Recently we struggled with GCC 12 false\npositive warnings many times. See [1][2].\n\nTo suppress this warning, we try to fool GCC compiler via minor code\nchange in this patch.\n\n[1] https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8299580\n[2] https:\/\/bugs.openjdk.org\/browse\/JDK-8294031"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/os_cpu\/linux_aarch64\/vm_version_linux_aarch64.cpp"}],"sha":"d80bebbd8038d8412d9f40a0e98561ca0cc1098e"}]
