This is not the way to\n+ * code SSLEngine-based servers, but works for what we need to do here,\n+ * which is to make sure that SSLEngine\/SSLSockets can talk to each other.\n+ * SSLEngines can use direct or indirect buffers, and different code\n+ * is used to get at the buffer contents internally, so we test that here.\n+ *\n+ * The test creates one SSLSocket (client) and one SSLEngine (server).\n+ * The SSLSocket talks to a raw ServerSocket, and the server code\n+ * does the translation between byte [] and ByteBuffers that the SSLEngine\n+ * can use.  The \"transport\" layer consists of a Socket Input\/OutputStream\n+ * and two byte buffers for the SSLEngines:  think of them\n+ * as directly connected pipes.\n+ *\n+ * Again, this is a *very* simple example: real code will be much more\n+ * involved.  For example, different threading and I\/O models could be\n+ * used, transport mechanisms could close unexpectedly, and so on.\n+ *\n+ * When this application runs, notice that several messages\n+ * (wrap\/unwrap) pass before any application data is consumed or\n+ * produced.  (For more information, please see the SSL\/TLS\n+ * specifications.)  There may several steps for a successful handshake,\n+ * so it's typical to see the following series of operations:\n+ *\n+ *      client          server          message\n+ *      ======          ======          =======\n+ *      write()         ...
