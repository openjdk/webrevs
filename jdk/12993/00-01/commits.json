[{"commit":{"message":"8303950: approaching using double-buffer approach instead\n\nThe PaintManager explicitly states that its for Swing components. This pulls some logic out of PaintManager that can be applied to generic awt.Components and introduces the AWTPaintManager super class.\n\nThe broad goal here is to take advantage of double-buffering AND avoid copying and pasting the hard work that the PaintManager already took care (regarding tiling, scaling, and looping attempts to use VolatileImages).\n\nThis is response to ongoing PR discussions; see https:\/\/github.com\/openjdk\/jdk\/pull\/12993#issuecomment-1470887449"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/java\/awt\/Window.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/javax\/swing\/RepaintManager.java"},{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/sun\/awt\/SunHints.java"}],"sha":"6a3a9b42bb705273e1ed9b1de0d04370e69c43ca"}]
