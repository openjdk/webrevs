[{"commit":{"message":"8303950: adding unit test for legacy window behavior\n\nThis test passes in the current JDK. The test criteria don't really reflect a rational expected behavior; they just reflect the current status quo.\n\nThis currently fails in this JDK-8303950 branch (using the new proposed AWTPaintManager), which indicates we've changed behavior.\n\nIn this case it's \"window 4\" that's failing. We used to get a mostly blue background, and now we're getting a background that's mostly red with a little blue. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; this failure is just documenting a change."},"files":[{"filename":"test\/jdk\/javax\/swing\/RepaintManager\/8303950\/bug8303950_legacyWindowPaintBehavior.java"}],"sha":"bd81761a1a5a6cf702cd3e8c6d1951a66730ca6f"}]
