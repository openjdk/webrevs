[{"commit":{"message":"8342785: Make AWT adhere to ICCCM 4.1.5 with all WMs\n\nIt is not guaranteed that the WM will always send a synthetic\nConfigureNotify event after changing the geometry. As ICCCM 4.1.5\nsuggests, the WM may not send a synthetic configure notify event if the\nwindow is resized for real. In that case, the client needs to use the\nTranslateCoordinates() request in order to determine the position of its\nwindow in the global coordinate space.\n\nHowever, it does so only with certain WMs. Some digging in the JDK\nhistory shows that AWT used to assume that synthetic configure notify\nevents are always sent, however it was not the case with WMs such as\nMetacity so the switch statement was added. I don't know exactly why the\nnew code path had been enabled only with handful of WMs, perhaps it was\ndone to play safe or as an optimization. But, in general, as the TODO\ncomment and the ICCCM spec say, this code needs to be enabled regardless\nof the WM."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/unix\/classes\/sun\/awt\/X11\/XWindowPeer.java"}],"sha":"7d22e3b23cda5b3f9676f1385ba66d60e597b621"}]
