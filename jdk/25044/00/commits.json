[{"commit":{"message":"8356137: Fixing non-zero transparent pixel with disposal method 1\n\nAlso adding accompanying unit test.\n\nI think there's been a mix-up regarding the sample image attached to the original ticket. This ticket should refer to `clyde.gif` (originally based on a data structure identified here: https:\/\/free-gifs.org\/gif\/CC0-3D ).\n\nThere is another similar looking (but different) ticket I filed last week for which `leo.gif` is the appropriate test case file. (See incident report 9218362. As far as I can see that hasn't made its way to the bug database yet.) I had to email both gifs to someone on the triage team, and I think they got mixed up."},"files":[{"filename":"src\/java.desktop\/share\/classes\/sun\/awt\/image\/GifImageDecoder.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/sun\/awt\/image\/gif\/bug8356137\/GifEmptyBackgroundTest.java"},{"filename":"test\/jdk\/sun\/awt\/image\/gif\/bug8356137\/clyde.gif"}],"sha":"5dbf7a11e7910f3b59a69bb30af57ec57cd750e5"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'master' of https:\/\/github.com\/mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"15cef1c4a6b3a884abfba10dd27492c0e553868f"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'master' of https:\/\/github.com\/mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"b9f767ba4014766bc830bd3471e22c30bda5ebce"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'master' of https:\/\/github.com\/mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"86b7944950f449cc2dd64f03d29d0e96efa93e76"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"cc97808bddff1de373fac1ad269f4654bd6dc2cf"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"026c3dbcc06a0d1f31a509953a2cca42b1e840c3"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge branch 'openjdk:master' into master"},"files":[],"sha":"93ef96abb3e5fb8712496adec0b865087099d45c"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #5 from openjdk\/master\n\nupdating to openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"81085d416d9ce4ef360ac0bb270a393ee9392d89"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #4 from openjdk\/master\n\nUpdating mickleness\/jdk from openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"69481fc38f4021224ec4a8d1a75b275a89dfa832"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #3 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge from openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"57346a421446d51192ceada277626ba1ae92d8d7"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #2 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge openjdk\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"333c87c2107262532815db6978c5e8f59c5a967e"},{"commit":{"message":"Merge pull request #1 from openjdk\/master\n\nMerge openjdk\/jdk into mickleness\/jdk"},"files":[],"sha":"5dbf0a67ad41a53e03f02c41b1b6364fc3a633ee"}]
