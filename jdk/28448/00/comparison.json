It happens that the load gets converted to a constant\n+ *          during the initial _gvn.transform(...) call. The MemBarAcquire node\n+ *          ends up with a constant node as its Precedent input, and this should\n+ *          trigger MemBar::Ideal if the MemBar is the only use of the constant.\n+ *          This test ensures that this optimization is not missed.\n+ * @run main\/othervm -XX:+IgnoreUnrecognizedVMOptions -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions\n+ *      -Xcomp -XX:-TieredCompilation\n+ *      -XX:CompileCommand=compileonly,*TestMissingOptMemBarRemovePrecedentEdge::test*\n+ *      -XX:VerifyIterativeGVN=1110\n+ *      -XX:-EliminateAutoBox\n+ *      -XX:-DoEscapeAnalysis\n+ *      compiler.c2.TestMissingOptMemBarRemovePrecedentEdge\n+ * @run main compiler.c2.TestMissingOptMemBarRemovePrecedentEdge\n+ *\n+ *\/\n+\n+package compiler.c2;\n+\n+public class TestMissingOptMemBarRemovePrecedentEdge {\n+    static class MyClass {\n+        volatile long l;\n+    }\n+\n+    static class MyClass2 {\n+        volatile MyClass o;\n+    }\n+\n+    static int test0() {\n+        var c = new MyClass();\n+        \/\/ the conversion ensures that the ConL node only has one use\n+        \/\/ in the end, which triggers the optimization\n+        return (int) c.l;\n+    }\n+\n+    static int test1() {\n+        var c = new MyClass2();\n+        \/\/ the Load gets folded to a ConP, and gets added to the worklist\n+        \/\/ because the basic type is T_OBJECT and there is specific logic\n+        \/\/ in GraphKit::make_load.\n+        \/\/ However this only happens if escape analysis is enabled\n+        if (c.o == null) return 0;\n+        else return 1;\n+    }\n+\n+    public static void main(String[] args) {\n+        new MyClass();\n+        new MyClass2();\n+        test0();\n+        test1();\n+    }\n+}\n\\ No newline at end of file\n","filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/compiler\/c2\/TestMissingOptMemBarRemovePrecedentEdge.java","additions":78,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":78,"status":"added"}]}
