They are more robust because they use phantom references,\n- * the weakest type of reference object, thereby avoiding the nasty ordering\n- * problems inherent to finalization.\n- *\n- * <p> A cleaner tracks a referent object and encapsulates a thunk of arbitrary\n- * cleanup code.  Some time after the GC detects that a cleaner's referent has\n- * become phantom-reachable, the reference-handler thread will run the cleaner.\n- * Cleaners may also be invoked directly; they are thread safe and ensure that\n- * they run their thunks at most once.\n- *\n- * <p> Cleaners are not a replacement for finalization.  They should be used\n- * only when the cleanup code is extremely simple and straightforward.\n- * Nontrivial cleaners are inadvisable since they risk blocking the\n- * reference-handler thread and delaying further cleanup and finalization.\n- *\n- *\n- * @author Mark Reinhold\n- *\/\n-\n-public class Cleaner\n-    extends PhantomReference<Object>\n-{\n-\n-    \/\/ Dummy reference queue, needed because the PhantomReference constructor\n-    \/\/ insists that we pass a queue.
