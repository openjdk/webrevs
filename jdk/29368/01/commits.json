These volatiles are used to indicate concurrent phased access (like changing the variable in thread A, then reading the variable in thread B while A is dormant, or only ever updating it in one direction) where concurrency safety is provided by barriers between these phases.\n\nThe exception is `G1ConcurrentMark::_finger` that has apparently been overlooked in an earlier changes.\n\nTesting: gha\n\nThanks,\n  Thomas"},"files":[{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.cpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.hpp"},{"filename":"src\/hotspot\/share\/gc\/g1\/g1ConcurrentMark.inline.hpp"}],"sha":"47925be92a174b00f1bc0dee07074b2680b73cd8"}]
