But the test `TestSelectFromTwoVectorOp.java` didn't rule out\nthese cases, leading to test faiulres on sve2 plaftforms where\n`MaxVectorSize > 16`.\n\nThis test problem was discovered by simulating a 512-bit sve2\nenvironment using qemu.\n\nThis PR fixes these test failures."},"files":[],"sha":"90842d7ad2fcce522186a4e1a75c3626a9e4515a"}]
