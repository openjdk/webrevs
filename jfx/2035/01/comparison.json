It is typically left-to-right by default, but can be right-to-left depending\n+ * on the locale of the operating system.\n+ * <p>\n+ * For layout containers, the effective orientation determines how children are ordered and how horizontal\n+ * positions are interpreted. In a left-to-right orientation, the first child usually appears at the left edge\n+ * and subsequent children flow to the right. Similarly, in a right-to-left orientation, the first child\n+ * usually appears at the right edge and subsequent children flow to the left. When a container exposes\n+ * named regions, the {@code left} region refers to the leading edge of the container, and the {@code right}\n+ * region refers to the trailing edge of the container. In right-to-left mode, the {@code left} region will\n+ * therefore be laid out on the right side, and the {@code right} region will be laid out on the left side.\n+ * <p>\n+ * Authors typically do not need to account for layout orientation when laying out nodes. In right-to-left\n+ * mode, a mirroring transform is automatically applied to nodes, flipping the visual flow in the horizontal\n+ * direction. If this behavior is not desired, nodes can override {@link javafx.scene.Node#usesMirroring()}\n+ * and return {@code false}.\n","filename":"modules\/javafx.graphics\/src\/main\/java\/javafx\/scene\/layout\/package-info.java","additions":23,"deletions":1,"binary":false,"changes":24,"status":"modified"}]}
