[{"commit":{"message":"8185887: Fix VirtualFlow performance regression in ListView scrolling\n\nThe commit 1b12c8a490 introduced two performance issues in VirtualFlow:\n\n1. Calling requestLayout() on all cells in the pile on every layout pass\n   This causes unnecessary layout calculations for 50-100 recycled cells\n   per frame during scrolling.\n\n2. Using sheetChildren.removeAll(pile) which has O(n*m) time complexity\n   This becomes extremely slow with large cell pools.\n\nThese changes caused severe scrolling lag in ListView\/TableView with\nmany items (e.g., 1000+ items). The fix removes both problematic code\nblocks while preserving the getViewportBreadth() visibility change\nneeded by TableRowSkinBase.\n\nTested with ListView containing 1000 items - scrolling is now smooth\nagain, matching JavaFX 24 performance."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.controls\/src\/main\/java\/javafx\/scene\/control\/skin\/VirtualFlow.java"}],"sha":"1ff2f8838ab1f87477624c2c7bead78f7c334662"}]
