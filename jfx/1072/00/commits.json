[{"commit":{"message":"Fix bug in CSS caching code that could reset values on unrelated nodes\n\nThe bug occurs due to a cache entry being constructed incorrectly when\nthe initial node that triggered the cache entry creation has user set\nvalues. The calculated values for properties with a user set value were\nomitted in the cache entry, and other nodes that later share the same\nentry would incorrectly assume the omitted property was unstyled and\nwere therefore reset to their default values."},"files":[{"filename":"modules\/javafx.graphics\/src\/main\/java\/javafx\/scene\/CssStyleHelper.java"},{"filename":"modules\/javafx.graphics\/src\/test\/java\/test\/javafx\/scene\/CssStyleHelperTest.java"}],"sha":"e0bb42d9b1ae109fc259ab8570a19f0ac71a41e9"}]
