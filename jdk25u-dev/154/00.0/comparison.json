Any caIssuers URIs in X.509 certificates are only\n+# followed when the com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers System property is\n+# enabled and the filter allows the URI. By default this property imposes a\n+# deny-all ruleset.  This property may be overridden by a System property\n+# of the same name.\n+#\n+# The filters must take the form of absolute, hierarchical URIs as defined by\n+# the java.net.URI class. Additionally, only the following protocols are\n+# allowed as filters: http, https, ldap and ftp.\n+# See RFC 5280, section 4.2.2.1 for details about the types of URIs allowed for\n+# the extension and their specific requirements.\n+# The filter matching rules are applied to each CA issuer URI as follows:\n+# 1. The scheme must match (case-insensitive).\n+# 2. A hostname or address must be specified in the filter URI.  It must match\n+#    the host or address in the caIssuers URI (case-insensitive).  No name\n+#    resolution is performed on hostnames to match IP addresses.\n+# 3. The port number must match.  For filter and caIssuer URIs, when a port\n+#    number is omitted, the well-known port for that scheme will be used in the\n+#    comparison.\n+# 4. For hierarchical filesystem schemes (e.g. http[s], ftp):\n+#    a. The normalized path portion of the filter URI is matched in a\n+#       case-sensitive manner.  If the final component of the path does not end\n+#       in a slash (\/), it is considered to be a file path component and must\n+#       be an exact match of the caIssuer's URI file path component.  If the\n+#       final filter component ends in a slash, then it must either match or be\n+#       a prefix of the caIssuer's URI path component (e.g. a filter path of\n+#       \/ab\/cd\/ will match a caIssuer path of \/ab\/cd\/, \/ab\/cd\/ef and\n+#       \/ab\/cd\/ef\/ghi).\n+#    b. Query strings will be ignored in filter rules and caIssuer URIs.\n+#    c. Fragments will be ignored in filter rules and caIssuer URIs.\n+# 5. For ldap URIs:\n+#    a. The base DN must be an exact match (case-insensitive).\n+#    b. Any query string in the rule, if specified, is ignored.\n+# 6. A single value \"any\" (case-insensitive) will create an allow-all rule.\n+#\n+# As an example, here is a valid filter policy consisting of two rules:\n+#    com.sun.security.allowedAIALocations=http:\/\/some.company.com\/cacert \\\n+#          ldap:\/\/ldap.company.com\/dc=company,dc=com?caCertificate;binary\n+com.sun.security.allowedAIALocations=\n","filename":"src\/java.base\/share\/conf\/security\/java.security","additions":45,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":45,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -187,0 +187,10 @@\n+\n+# Mechanically added:\n+runtime\/Thread\/TestThreadDumpMonitorContention.java 8361370 windows-x64\n+runtime\/Thread\/StopAtExit.java 8365835 linux-x64\n+runtime\/Thread\/SetPriorityAtExit.java 8365835 linux-x64\n+runtime\/Thread\/SuspendAtExit.java 8365835 linux-x64\n+runtime\/Thread\/SetNameAtExit.java 8365835 linux-x64\n+runtime\/8176717\/TestInheritFD.java 8347001 linux-x64\n+vmTestbase\/nsk\/jdi\/stress\/serial\/mixed002\/TestDescription.java 8291514 macosx-aarch64\n+serviceability\/jvmti\/RedefineClasses\/ClassVersionAfterRedefine.java 8369953 linux-aarch64,linux-x64,macosx-aarch64,windows-x64\n","filename":"test\/hotspot\/jtreg\/ProblemList.txt","additions":10,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":10,"status":"modified"},{"patch":"@@ -828,0 +828,4 @@\n+\n+# Mechanically added:\n+javax\/sound\/midi\/Soundbanks\/ExtraCharInSoundbank.java 8350613 linux-aarch64,linux-x64\n+java\/net\/CookieHandler\/B6644726.java 8366103 linux-aarch64,linux-x64,macosx-aarch64,windows-x64\n","filename":"test\/jdk\/ProblemList.txt","additions":4,"deletions":0,"binary":false,"changes":4,"status":"modified"}]}
