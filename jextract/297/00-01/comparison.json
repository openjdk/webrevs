If your \/bin\/sh is\n+#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n+#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n+#       command line, like:\n+#\n+#           ksh Gradle\n+#\n+#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n+#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n+#         * functions;\n+#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n+#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n+#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n+#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n+#\n+#   Important for patching:\n+#\n+#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n+#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n+#\n+#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n+#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n+#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n+#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n+#\n+#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n+#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n+#       see the in-line comments for details.\n+#\n+#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n+#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n+#\n+#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n+#       https:\/\/github.com\/gradle\/gradle\/blob\/HEAD\/platforms\/jvm\/plugins-application\/src\/main\/resources\/org\/gradle\/api\/internal\/plugins\/unixStartScript.txt\n+#       within the Gradle project.\n+#\n+#       You can find Gradle at https:\/\/github.com\/gradle\/gradle\/.\n+#\n+##############################################################################\n+\n+# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n+\n+# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\n+app_path=$0\n+\n+# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\n+while\n+    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*\/}\"}  # leaves a trailing \/; empty if no leading path\n+    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\n+do\n+    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n+    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n+    case $link in             #(\n+      \/*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n+      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n+    esac\n+done\n+\n+# This is normally unused\n+# shellcheck disable=SC2034\n+APP_BASE_NAME=${0##*\/}\n+# Discard cd standard output in case $CDPATH is set (https:\/\/github.com\/gradle\/gradle\/issues\/25036)\n+APP_HOME=$( cd -P \"${APP_HOME:-.\/}\" > \/dev\/null && printf '%s\n+' \"$PWD\" ) || exit\n+\n+# Use the maximum available, or set MAX_FD != -1 to use that value.\n+MAX_FD=maximum\n+\n+warn () {\n+    echo \"$*\"\n+} >&2\n+\n+die () {\n+    echo\n+    echo \"$*\"\n+    echo\n+    exit 1\n+} >&2\n+\n+# OS specific support (must be 'true' or 'false').\n+cygwin=false\n+msys=false\n+darwin=false\n+nonstop=false\n+case \"$( uname )\" in                #(\n+  CYGWIN* )         cygwin=true  ;; #(\n+  Darwin* )         darwin=true  ;; #(\n+  MSYS* | MINGW* )  msys=true    ;; #(\n+  NONSTOP* )        nonstop=true ;;\n+esac\n+\n+CLASSPATH=$APP_HOME\/gradle\/wrapper\/gradle-wrapper.jar\n+\n+\n+# Determine the Java command to use to start the JVM.\n+if [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n+    if [ -x \"$JAVA_HOME\/jre\/sh\/java\" ] ; then\n+        # IBM's JDK on AIX uses strange locations for the executables\n+        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME\/jre\/sh\/java\n+    else\n+        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME\/bin\/java\n+    fi\n+    if [ ! -x \"$JAVACMD\" ] ; then\n+        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: $JAVA_HOME\n+\n+Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\n+location of your Java installation.\"\n+    fi\n+else\n+    JAVACMD=java\n+    if ! command -v java >\/dev\/null 2>&1\n+    then\n+        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.\n+\n+Please set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\n+location of your Java installation.\"\n+    fi\n+fi\n+\n+# Increase the maximum file descriptors if we can.\n+if ! \"$cygwin\" && ! \"$darwin\" && ! \"$nonstop\" ; then\n+    case $MAX_FD in #(\n+      max*)\n+        # In POSIX sh, ulimit -H is undefined.
