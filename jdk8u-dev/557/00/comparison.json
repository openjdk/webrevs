By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n-    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n-    type 'show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n-called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n-if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n-is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n-License instead of this License.\n-\n-\n-\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n-subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n-only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n-the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n-exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n-    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n-    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n-    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n-    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n-    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n-    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n-    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n-    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n-    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n","filename":"corba\/LICENSE","additions":0,"deletions":347,"binary":false,"changes":347,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,3371 +0,0 @@\n-DO NOT TRANSLATE OR LOCALIZE.\n------------------------------\n-\n-%% This notice is provided with respect to ASM Bytecode Manipulation \n-Framework v5.0.3, which may be included with JRE 8, and JDK 8, and \n-OpenJDK 8.\n-\n---- begin of LICENSE ---\n-\n-Copyright (c) 2000-2011 France T??l??com\n-All rights reserved.\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n-are met:\n-\n-1.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Conditions\n-\n-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n-in Section 2.1.\n-\n-3. Responsibilities\n--------------------\n-\n-3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n-prior to termination shall survive termination.\n-\n-************************************************************************\n-*                                                                      *\n-*  6.

Miscellaneous\n-----------------\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n-\n-10.

Except as provided in Section\n-10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n-publish new versions of this License.

Modified Versions\n-\n-If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n-create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n-modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n-any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n-such modified license differs from this License).\n-\n-10.4.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n-      meet the following conditions:\n-\n-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n-\n-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n-          stating that You changed the files; and\n-\n-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n-          the Derivative Works; and\n-\n-      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n-          as modifying the License.\n-\n-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n-      the conditions stated in this License.\n-\n-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n-\n-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n-\n-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n-\n-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n-\n-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n-      or other liability obligations and\/or rights consistent with this\n-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n-\n-   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n-\n-      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n-      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n-      replaced with your own identifying information.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Effective Date\n-\n-The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\n-become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\n-distributes such Contribution.\n-\n-2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n-\n-The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n-this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n-distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n-Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n-Contributor:\n-\n-(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n-    or\n-\n-(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n-    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n-    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n-    Version); or\n-\n-(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n-    its Contributions.\n-\n-This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n-or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n-the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n-\n-2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n-\n-No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n-distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n-License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n-permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n-\n-2.5. Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6. Fair Use\n-\n-This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n-applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n-equivalents.\n-\n-2.7. Conditions\n-\n-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n-in Section 2.1.\n-\n-3. Responsibilities\n--------------------\n-\n-3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n-prior to termination shall survive termination.\n-\n-************************************************************************\n-*                                                                      *\n-*  6.

Litigation\n--------------\n-\n-Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n-courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n-place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n-jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n-Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n-cross-claims or counter-claims.\n-\n-9. Miscellaneous\n-----------------\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n-\n-10. Versions of the License\n----------------------------\n-\n-10.1. New Versions\n-\n-Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n-10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n-publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n-distinguishing version number.\n-\n-10.2. Effect of New Versions\n-\n-You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n-of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n-or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n-steward.\n-\n-10.3. Modified Versions\n-\n-If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n-create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n-modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n-any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n-such modified license differs from this License).\n-\n-10.4.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n-      or other liability obligations and\/or rights consistent with this\n-      License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n-    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n-    type 'show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n-called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n-if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n-is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n-License instead of this License.\n-\n-\n-\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n-subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n-only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n-the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n-exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n-    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n-    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n-    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n-    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n-    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n-    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n-    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n-    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n-    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n","filename":"jaxp\/LICENSE","additions":0,"deletions":347,"binary":false,"changes":347,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,3371 +0,0 @@\n-DO NOT TRANSLATE OR LOCALIZE.\n------------------------------\n-\n-%% This notice is provided with respect to ASM Bytecode Manipulation \n-Framework v5.0.3, which may be included with JRE 8, and JDK 8, and \n-OpenJDK 8.\n-\n---- begin of LICENSE ---\n-\n-Copyright (c) 2000-2011 France T??l??com\n-All rights reserved.\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n-are met:\n-\n-1.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6.

Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n-    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n-    type 'show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n-called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n-if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n-is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n-License instead of this License.\n-\n-\n-\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n-subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n-only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n-the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n-exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n-    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n-    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n-    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n-    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n-    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n-    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n-    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n-    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n-    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n","filename":"jaxws\/LICENSE","additions":0,"deletions":347,"binary":false,"changes":347,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,3371 +0,0 @@\n-DO NOT TRANSLATE OR LOCALIZE.\n------------------------------\n-\n-%% This notice is provided with respect to ASM Bytecode Manipulation \n-Framework v5.0.3, which may be included with JRE 8, and JDK 8, and \n-OpenJDK 8.\n-\n---- begin of LICENSE ---\n-\n-Copyright (c) 2000-2011 France T??l??com\n-All rights reserved.\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n-are met:\n-\n-1.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitations on Grant Scope\n-\n-The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n-this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n-distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n-Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n-Contributor:\n-\n-(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n-    or\n-\n-(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n-    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n-    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n-    Version); or\n-\n-(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n-    its Contributions.\n-\n-This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n-or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n-the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n-\n-2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n-\n-No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n-distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n-License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n-permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n-\n-2.5. Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6. Fair Use\n-\n-This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n-applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n-equivalents.\n-\n-2.7. Conditions\n-\n-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n-in Section 2.1.\n-\n-3. Responsibilities\n--------------------\n-\n-3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n-prior to termination shall survive termination.\n-\n-************************************************************************\n-*                                                                      *\n-*  6.

Litigation\n--------------\n-\n-Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n-courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n-place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n-jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n-Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n-cross-claims or counter-claims.\n-\n-9. Miscellaneous\n-----------------\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n-\n-10. Versions of the License\n----------------------------\n-\n-10.1. New Versions\n-\n-Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n-10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n-publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n-distinguishing version number.\n-\n-10.2. Effect of New Versions\n-\n-You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n-of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n-or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n-steward.\n-\n-10.3. Modified Versions\n-\n-If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n-create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n-modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n-any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n-such modified license differs from this License).\n-\n-10.4.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n-      or other liability obligations and\/or rights consistent with this\n-      License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n-    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n-    type 'show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n-called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n-if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n-is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n-License instead of this License.\n-\n-\n-\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n-subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n-only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n-the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n-exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n-    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n-    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n-    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n-    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n-    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n-    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n-    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n-    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n-    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n","filename":"jdk\/LICENSE","additions":0,"deletions":347,"binary":false,"changes":347,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,3371 +0,0 @@\n-DO NOT TRANSLATE OR LOCALIZE.\n------------------------------\n-\n-%% This notice is provided with respect to ASM Bytecode Manipulation \n-Framework v5.0.3, which may be included with JRE 8, and JDK 8, and \n-OpenJDK 8.\n-\n---- begin of LICENSE ---\n-\n-Copyright (c) 2000-2011 France T??l??com\n-All rights reserved.\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n-are met:\n-\n-1.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6.

Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n-    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n-    type 'show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n-called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n-if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n-is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n-License instead of this License.\n-\n-\n-\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n-subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n-only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n-the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n-exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n-    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n-    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n-    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n-    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n-    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n-    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n-    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n-    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitations on Grant Scope\n-\n-The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n-this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n-distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n-Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n-Contributor:\n-\n-(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n-    or\n-\n-(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n-    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n-    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n-    Version); or\n-\n-(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n-    its Contributions.\n-\n-This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n-or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n-the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n-\n-2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n-\n-No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n-distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n-License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n-permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n-\n-2.5. Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6. Fair Use\n-\n-This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n-applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n-equivalents.\n-\n-2.7. Conditions\n-\n-Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n-in Section 2.1.\n-\n-3. Responsibilities\n--------------------\n-\n-3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n-end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n-have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n-prior to termination shall survive termination.\n-\n-************************************************************************\n-*                                                                      *\n-*  6.

Litigation\n--------------\n-\n-Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\n-courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\n-place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n-jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n-Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n-cross-claims or counter-claims.\n-\n-9. Miscellaneous\n-----------------\n-\n-This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n-matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n-unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n-necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\n-that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\n-shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n-\n-10. Versions of the License\n----------------------------\n-\n-10.1. New Versions\n-\n-Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n-10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n-publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n-distinguishing version number.\n-\n-10.2. Effect of New Versions\n-\n-You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n-of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n-or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n-steward.\n-\n-10.3. Modified Versions\n-\n-If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n-create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n-modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n-any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n-such modified license differs from this License).\n-\n-10.4.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n-      or other liability obligations and\/or rights consistent with this\n-      License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\n-guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\n-software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\n-most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\n-authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\n-covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\n-General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\n-distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\n-that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\n-the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\n-can do these things.\n-\n-To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\n-you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\n-translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\n-software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\n-a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\n-make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\n-show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\n-offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\n-and\/or modify the software.\n-\n-Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\n-everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\n-software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\n-know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\n-by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n-\n-Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\n-wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\n-individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\n-To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\n-everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\n-follow.\n-\n-TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n-placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\n-or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n-derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n-Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or\n-translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\n-without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n-\"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\n-this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\n-not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\n-constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\n-running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n-you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n-disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\n-and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\n-Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n-at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\n-forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\n-or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\n-these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n-    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n-    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n-    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n-    this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n-    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n-    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n-    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n-    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n-    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n-    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n-    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n-    not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n-considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\n-its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\n-works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\n-work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\n-of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\n-whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n-right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n-the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\n-Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n-distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n-License.\n-\n-3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n-Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n-2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n-    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n-    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n-    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n-    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n-    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n-    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n-    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n-    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n-    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n-    Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n-modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\n-the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n-definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\n-of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\n-distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\n-source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\n-of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\n-code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\n-third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n-expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\n-sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\n-your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\n-rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\n-long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n-However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\n-or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\n-accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\n-any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\n-do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n-the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\n-copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\n-You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\n-rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\n-third parties to this License.\n-\n-7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\n-are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\n-contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n-conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\n-simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n-obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\n-For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\n-of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\n-you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n-the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n-other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n-section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n-distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\n-people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n-distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n-distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n-choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n-consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-8. If the distribution and\/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\n-countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\n-copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\n-geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\n-distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\n-such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\n-of this License.\n-\n-9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the\n-General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\n-spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\n-or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\n-version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\n-that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\n-choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n-\n-10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\n-whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\n-permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\n-write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\n-Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\n-all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\n-software generally.\n-\n-NO WARRANTY\n-\n-11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\n-THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\n-STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\n-PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n-INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\n-FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n-PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\n-YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n-ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\n-PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\n-INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\n-BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\n-OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\n-use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\n-which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\n-them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\n-of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\n-pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n-\n-    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n-    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n-    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n-    any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n-    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n-    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n-    more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\n-starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n-    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n-    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n-    type 'show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\n-called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\n-if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\n-is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n-\n-    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\n-License instead of this License.\n-\n-\n-\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n-\n-Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and\/or its affiliates are\n-subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\n-only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\n-the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\n-exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n-\n-    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n-    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n-    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n-\n-    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n-    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n-    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n-    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n-    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n-    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n-    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n-    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n-    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n-    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n","filename":"nashorn\/LICENSE","additions":0,"deletions":347,"binary":false,"changes":347,"status":"deleted"},{"patch":"@@ -1,3371 +0,0 @@\n-DO NOT TRANSLATE OR LOCALIZE.\n------------------------------\n-\n-%% This notice is provided with respect to ASM Bytecode Manipulation \n-Framework v5.0.3, which may be included with JRE 8, and JDK 8, and \n-OpenJDK 8.\n-\n---- begin of LICENSE ---\n-\n-Copyright (c) 2000-2011 France T??l??com\n-All rights reserved.\n-\n-Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n-modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n-are met:\n-\n-1.

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-\n-                            Preamble\n-\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.\n-\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-\f\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operating\n-system.\n-\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-\f\n-                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-\f\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n-\n-    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-    its purpose remains meaningful.\n-\n-    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-    root function must still compute square roots.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n-it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Library.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n-with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-\f\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-\n-  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-\f\n-  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n-    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n-    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n-    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n-    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n-    uses the Library\", as object code and\/or source code, so that the\n-    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n-    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n-    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n-    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n-    to use the modified definitions.)\n-\n-    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n-    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n-    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n-    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n-    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n-    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n-    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n-\n-    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n-    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n-    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n-\n-    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n-    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n-    specified materials from the same place.\n-\n-    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n-    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n-\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-\f\n-  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n-Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n-facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n-library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n-the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n-permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-\n-    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n-    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n-    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n-    Sections above.\n-\n-    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n-    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n-    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n-\n-  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n-the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n-attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n-distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n-rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n-or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n-terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-\n-  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-\f\n-  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  12. If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-\f\n-  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-                            NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-\n-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\f\n-           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n-\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n-    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Representation\n-\n-Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n-Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n-to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n-\n-2.6.

Distribution of Source Form\n-\n-All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n-Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n-the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n-Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n-License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n-attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n-Form.\n-\n-3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n-\n-If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n-\n-(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n-    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n-    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n-    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n-    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n-\n-(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n-    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n-    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n-    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n-\n-3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n-\n-You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n-provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n-the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n-Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n-Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n-License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n-under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n-the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n-Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n-License(s).\n-\n-3.4. Notices\n-\n-You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n-(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n-or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n-the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n-the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n-\n-3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n-\n-You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n-Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n-behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n-such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n-You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n-liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n-indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n-disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n-jurisdiction.\n-\n-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n----------------------------------------------------\n-\n-If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n-License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n-statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n-the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n-describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\n-be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\n-Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\n-or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\n-recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n-\n-5. Termination\n---------------\n-\n-5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n-if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n-compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n-Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n-ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n-non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n-come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n-Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n-notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n-first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n-from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n-Your receipt of the notice.\n-\n-5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n-infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n-counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n-directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n-You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n-2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n-\n-5.3.

The\n-   terms of the GNU General Public License still apply as compressing\n-   a program is a special form of linking with our stub.\n-\n-   Hereby Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer and Laszlo Molnar grant you special\n-   permission to freely use and distribute all UPX compressed programs\n-   (including commercial ones), subject to the following restrictions:\n-\n-   1. You must compress your program with a completely unmodified UPX\n-      version; either with our precompiled version, or (at your option)\n-      with a self compiled version of the unmodified UPX sources as\n-      distributed by us.\n-   2. This also implies that the UPX stub must be completely unmodfied, i.e.\n-      the stub imbedded in your compressed program must be byte-identical\n-      to the stub that is produced by the official unmodified UPX version.\n-   3. The decompressor and any other code from the stub must exclusively get\n-      used by the unmodified UPX stub for decompressing your program at\n-      program startup. No portion of the stub may get read, copied,\n-      called or otherwise get used or accessed by your program.\n-\n-\n-ANNOTATIONS\n-===========\n-\n-  - You can use a modified UPX version or modified UPX stub only for\n-    programs that are compatible with the GNU General Public License.\n-\n-  - We grant you special permission to freely use and distribute all UPX\n-    compressed programs. But any modification of the UPX stub (such as,\n-    but not limited to, removing our copyright string or making your\n-    program non-decompressible) will immediately revoke your right to\n-    use and distribute a UPX compressed program.\n-\n-  - UPX is not a software protection tool; by requiring that you use\n-    the unmodified UPX version for your proprietary programs we\n-    make sure that any user can decompress your program. This protects\n-    both you and your users as nobody can hide malicious code -\n-    any program that cannot be decompressed is highly suspicious\n-    by definition.\n-\n-  - You can integrate all or part of UPX and UCL into projects that\n-    are compatible with the GNU GPL, but obviously you cannot grant\n-    any special exceptions beyond the GPL for our code in your project.\n-\n-  - We want to actively support manufacturers of virus scanners and\n-    similar security software. Please contact us if you would like to\n-    incorporate parts of UPX or UCL into such a product.\n-\n-\n-\n-Markus F.X.J.
